"Meyler J.; Ruston D.";0.0;Presbyopia;2023;Contact Lens Practice, Fourth Edition;10.1016/B978-0-7020-8427-0.00022-2;An overview of the optimal approach to fitting presbyopes with contact lenses is described, together with a consideration of contact lens designs available and the optimal fitting approach. The main bifocal types are simultaneous image designs (which may be aspheric or hybrid), alternating (translating) image designs and monovision, which can be enhanced or modified monovision. Patient considerations, initial measurement protocols, lens fitting and lens adjustment are discussed. The percentage of multifocal or monovision contact lenses prescribed for contact lens-wearing presbyopes falls short of what would be required for the proper correction of presbyopia in this cohort. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

"Animali S.; Steinwurzel C.; Dardano A.; Sancho-Bornez V.; Del Prato S.; Morrone M.C.; Daniele G.; Binda P.";0.0;Effect of fasting on short-term visual plasticity in adult humans;2023;European Journal of Neuroscience;10.1111/ejn.15873;Brain plasticity and function is impaired in conditions of metabolic dysregulation, such as obesity. Less is known on whether brain function is also affected by transient and physiological metabolic changes, such as the alternation between fasting and fed state. Here we asked whether these changes affect the transient shift of ocular dominance that follows short-term monocular deprivation, a form of homeostatic plasticity. We further asked whether variations in three of the main metabolic and hormonal pathways affected in obesity (glucose metabolism, leptin signalling and fatty acid metabolism) correlate with plasticity changes. We measured the effects of 2 h monocular deprivation in three conditions: post-absorptive state (fasting), after ingestion of a standardised meal and during infusion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin physiologically released upon meal ingestion that plays a key role in glucose metabolism. We found that short-term plasticity was less manifest in fasting than in fed state, whereas GLP-1 infusion did not elicit reliable changes compared to fasting. Although we confirmed a positive association between plasticity and supraphysiological GLP-1 levels, achieved by GLP-1 infusion, we found that none of the parameters linked to glucose metabolism could predict the plasticity reduction in the fasting versus fed state. Instead, this was selectively associated with the increase in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (B-OH) levels during fasting, which suggests a link between neural function and energy substrates alternative to glucose. These results reveal a previously unexplored link between homeostatic brain plasticity and the physiological changes associated with the daily fast-fed cycle. © 2022 The Authors.

"Dhiman R.; Mahalingam K.; Balakrishnan N.; Kumar A.; Saxena R.; Sihota R.";0.0;Effect of legislation and changing trends of Diwali ocular firecracker injuries in Northern India;2022;Oman Journal of Ophthalmology;10.4103/ojo.ojo_303_21;"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to study the impact of temporary legislation implemented during Diwali on ocular firecracker injuries in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, records of the patients presenting with ocular firecracker injury during 10 days of Diwali (prediwali, Diwali and 8 days postdiwali) from 2014 to 2019 were retreived from the medical record section. Clinico-demographic profile, relevant history pertaining to the use of firecracker, and details of eye examination, namely presenting visual acuity (VA), laterality and classification of injury based on Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology System were noted. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty-seven eyes of 646 patients were recruited. The median age of patients was 14 years (R = 3-65 years) and male: Female ratio was 4.9:1. Majority of patients (57.7%; n = 373) were from outside Delhi. Most of them were open globe injuries (66.8%). In 55.4% (n = 356) eyes, presenting VA was perception of light to finger counting close to face and 28% (n = 180) eyes could not perceive any light. A significant reduction was noted in the number of ocular firecrcaker injuries after regulation (preregulation [2014-2016] n = 456; postregulation [2017-2019] n = 211; [P = 0.01, t-Test]). During preregulation period, presenting VA was worse than 1/60 in significantly higher number of eyes (85.5%; n = 376) than post regulation (78.8%, n = 160) (P = 0.03, Chi-square test). CONCLUSION: Although temporary legislation seems to be effective in reducing ocular firecracker injuries (52.7% reduction) in NCR, uniform implementation of stricter laws nationwide is essential to further minimize the problem. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

"Olmos J.; Valenzuela B.; Martínez F.";0.0;Quantification of Parkinsonian unilateral involvement from ocular fixational patterns using a deep video representation;2023;Health and Technology;10.1007/s12553-023-00782-y;Purpose: Lateralisation of motor symptoms is a prevalent characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Hence, unilateral involvement is crucial for personalized treatments and measuring therapy effectiveness. Nonetheless, most motor symptoms, including lateralization, are mainly evident at advanced stages of the disease. Recently, ocular fixation instability emerged as a promising PD biomarker with a high sensitivity to discriminate PD. We hypothesize that unilateral involvement can be recovered from the assessment and quantification of PD-related ocular abnormalities. Methods: This method proposes a computer-based strategy to quantify PD lateralization from ocular fixation patterns. The method follows a markerless strategy fed by slices with spatiotemporal eye movement information. A deep convolutional model was used to discriminate between PD and a control population. Additionally, model prediction probabilities were analyzed to select the dominant eye associated with unilateral involvement. Results: The proposed approach reports an average accuracy of 91.92% classifying PD. Interestingly, using the dominant side, the approach achieves an average PD prediction probability of 93.3% (95% CI: [91.61,95.07]), evidencing capabilities to capture the most affected side. Besides, the reported results strongly correlate with the disease, even for patients categorized at early stages. A low-dimensional projection tool was used to support the classification results by finding a 2d space that eases the discrimination among classes. Conclusions: The strategy is sensitive to detecting and classifying PD fixational patterns and determining the side with major impairments. This approach may be a potential tool to support the characterization of the disease and as an alternative to defining personalized treatments. © 2023, The Author(s).

Therefore, the aim was to quantify the effect of physical stain volume, chroma and size on wetness perception, and to compare wetness perception under different sensory conditions, including visuotactile and visual only interactions. Eighteen participants visually observed and/or used their index fingerpad to dynamically interact with stimuli varying in physical wetness (0, 2.16 × 10−4 or 3.45 × 10−4 ml mm−2), stain chroma (clear, light, dark) and stain size (1150 or 5000 mm2). After interaction participants rated wetness perception using a visual analogue scale (very dry to very wet). In visual only conditions participants were able to differentiate between dry and wet stimuli, and could also discriminate between different magnitudes of wetness with the addition of tactile cues. In both visual only and visuotactile conditions greater stain chroma resulted in increased wetness perception. Stain size did not have a significant effect in either condition. These results show that visual cues influence wetness perception (R2 = 0.29), but indicate that visual dominance does not apply in these sensory integrations. Findings are relevant for the design of products with wetness management properties. © IMechE 2023.

A total of 26 healthy young subjects were enrolled. The participants participated in two sessions: one without alcohol consumption and another after alcohol consumption. In each session and for the different filter conditions (subjects were wearing Bangerter foil of 0.8 and BPM2 fog filter on the dominant eye), monocular and binocular visual function was evaluated by measuring visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual discrimination capacity (and successively by calculating their corresponding binocular summations) and stereopsis (near and distance stereoacuity). In addition, interocular differences were calculated for different retinal–image quality and straylight parameters. All monocular and binocular visual functions were analyzed and stereopsis was significantly impaired by alcohol and filters (p < 0.05). Interocular differences for different ocular parameters and binocular summations for visual parameters were negatively affected by filters but not alcohol. Significant correlations (averaging all the experimental conditions analyzed) were found, highlighting: the higher the interocular differences, the lower the binocular summation and the poorer the stereopsis and, therefore, the worse the binocular visual performance. © 2023 by the authors.
"Zhao J.; Bao M.";0.0;A method for studying unconscious motion processing based on the camouflage principle;2022;Acta Psychologica Sinica;10.3724/SP.J.1041.2022.00725;The present study introduces a new continuous flash suppression (CFS) paradigm. We used the principle of alpha blending to keep the color of the target stimuli always consistent with that of the masking stimuli. We randomly recruited eight participants. Their dominant eyes were presented with the regular CFS masks. Meanwhile the non-dominant eyes were presented with ten spatially non-overlapping squares moving at a constant velocity. The results showed that the CFS masks in this new paradigm could efficiently block the conscious processing of the multiple moving targets. Furthermore, the breakthrough rate was the lowest when the colors of the targets were fully consistent with the colors of the CFS masks. This suggests that the new paradigm is more powerful than the traditional CFS paradigm in masking dynamic stimuli. Compared with the prevalent idea of modifying CFS masks, our method is believed to have broader applicability. Therefore, we recommend the new paradigm a useful tool for future investigations of unconscious visual motion information processing. © 2022 Chinese Psychological Society.

The ocular-opponency-neuron model of binocular rivalry has been proposed as a candidate account for this phenomenon. Yet direct neural evidence is still lacking. By manipulating the contrast of dichoptic testing gratings, here we measured the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) at the intermodulation frequencies to selectively track the activities of ocular-opponency-neurons before and after the “dichoptic-backward-movie” adaptation. One hour of adaptation caused a shift of perceptual and neural ocular dominance towards the unattended eye. More importantly, we found a decrease in the intermodulation SSVEP response after adaptation, which was significantly greater when high-contrast gratings were presented to the attended eye than when they were presented to the unattended eye. These results strongly support the view that the adaptation of ocular-opponency-neurons contributes to the ocular dominance plasticity induced by prolonged eye-based attention. © 2023, Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

To achieve this effect, rapidly flashing noise masks are presented to the dominant eye while a static stimulus is presented to the non-dominant eye. Eventually “breakthrough” occurs, wherein awareness shifts to the static image shown to the non-dominant eye. We tested the hypothesis that Gestalt formation can promote breakthrough. In two experiments, we presented pacman-shaped objects that might or might not align to form illusory Kanizsa objects. To measure the inception of breakthrough, observers were instructed to press a key at the moment of partial breakthrough. After pressing the key, which stopped the trial, observers reported how many pacmen were seen and where they were located. Supporting the Gestalt hypothesis, breakthrough was faster when the pacmen were aligned and observers more often reported pairs of pacmen if they were aligned. To address whether these effects reflected illusory shape perception, a computational model was applied to the pacman report distributions and breakthrough times for an experiment with four pacmen. A full account of the data required an increased joint probability of reporting all four pacmen, suggesting an influence of a perceived illusory cross. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

What has not been considered is whether the internal neural states modulate visual sensitivity to short-term monocular deprivation. In this study we manipulated the internal neural state and reported changes in intrinsic neural oscillations with a patched eye open or closed. We investigated the influence of eye open/eye closure on the unpatched eye’s contrast sensitivity and ocular dominance (OD) shifts induced by short-term monocular deprivation. The results demonstrate that internal neural states influence not only baseline contrast sensitivity but also the extent to which the adult visual system can undergo changes in ocular dominance. © 2023, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Whereas previous research has shown that audio-visual scenes are recognized more accurately than their unimodal counterparts, it remains unclear whether this benefit stems from audio-visually integrated long-term memory representations or a summation of independent retrieval cues. We tested two predictions for audio-visually integrated memory representations. First, we used a modeling approach to test whether recognition performance for audio-visual scenes is more accurate than would be expected from independent retrieval cues. This analysis shows that audio-visual integration is not necessary to explain the benefit of audio-visual scenes relative to purely auditory or purely visual scenes. Second, we report a series of experiments investigating the occurrence of study-test congruency effects for unimodal and audio-visual scenes. Most importantly, visually encoded information was immune to additional auditory information presented during testing, whereas auditory encoded information was susceptible to additional visual information presented during testing. This renders a true integration of visual and auditory information in long-term memory representations unlikely. In sum, our results instead provide evidence for visual dominance in long-term memory. Whereas associative auditory information is capable of enhancing memory performance, the long-term memory representations appear to be primarily visual. © 2022, The Author(s).

Methods: This is a prospective cross-sectional study, including 345 eyes. All children underwent complete history taking and ophthalmic examination. Any glaucomatous patients or glaucoma suspects were excluded. Intraocular pressure was measured using Haag Streit Perkins M2 handheld applanation tonometer under topical or general anaesthesia. Three readings were recorded for each eye and the average was calculated. Central corneal thickness was measured, using handheld pachymeter (Pachmate 2), whenever possible. Results: The study included 345 eyes of 187 children (101 males and 86 females), aged 2 months to 12 years (mean: 5.69 ± 3.42 years). The recorded IOP was 5–20 mm Hg (mean: 11.5 ± 2.34 mm Hg). Central corneal thickness was 469–742 μm (mean: 564.8 ± 42.72 μm). The mean recorded intraocular pressure showed positive correlation with increased age (p = 0.026) and increased central corneal thickness (p = 0.037), with a difference of 1 mm Hg for every 100-μm change in central corneal thickness. The mean IOP was significantly lower than that recorded by most previous studies. A detailed comparative analysis is presented comparing our findings with other studies including grouped analysis, by country, ethnicity and tonometers used. Conclusions: The mean IOP in a group of normal Egyptian children was 11.5 ± 2.34 mm Hg, with positive correlation to age and central corneal thickness. This mean intraocular pressure was lower than that previously reported in any other population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.
"Hou X.; Zhang X.; Zhang Z.";0.0;Case Report: Asymmetric Changes of Ophthalmic Findings in Bilateral Solar Eclipse Maculopathy;2023;Optometry and Vision Science;10.1097/OPX.0000000000002012;SIGNIFICANCE A more profound understanding of the relationship between ophthalmic findings and eye dominance is needed to guide the timely and proper treatment of binocular photic maculopathy or other macular degeneration. PURPOSE A patient with binocular solar maculopathy presented with asymmetric ophthalmic manifestations and changes during 14 months of observation. Early recognition of solar maculopathy can be vital for early diagnosis and better prognosis. CASE REPORT A 21-year-old man was reported to have blurred vision after staring directly at an annular solar eclipse several times for a few seconds on June 21, 2020. His Snellen best-corrected visual acuity declined to 20/50 in both eyes. He was right-eye dominant according to the hole-in-the-card test. The funduscopy found a yellow spot in the center of both maculae. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images revealed a full-thickness hyperreflectivity extending from the inner retinal layers to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) along with a localized disruption of the ellipsoid portion of the inner segments and RPE in both eyes. The medical history and clinical manifestations described previously supported the diagnosis of solar maculopathy. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images during follow-up indicated a diminishing disruption of the ellipsoid portion of the inner segments and RPE without treatment. Interestingly, the nondominant left eye made a better anatomical recovery. Finally, the Snellen best-corrected visual acuity remained 20/20 in both eyes after 14 months. CONCLUSIONS Binocular solar maculopathy can present asymmetrically and recover asymmetrically as well. The dominant eye suffered more obvious damage and poorer anatomical recovery than the nondominant eye.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Little is known about the neurophysiological correlates that are associated with these deficits. Moreover, the additional examination of visual attention during ER would allow a more in-depth understanding of ER deficits but has not yet been applied simultaneously. Methods: N = 33 adolescents with MD and n = 35 healthy controls (HCs) aged 12–18 years performed an ER task during which they either a) down-regulated their negative affective response to negative images via cognitive reappraisal or b) attended the images without changing their affective response. During the task, the Late Positive Potential (LPP), gaze fixations on emotional image aspects, and self-reported affective responses were collected simultaneously. Results: Compared to HCs, adolescents with MD demonstrated reduced ER success based on self-report but did not differ in LPP amplitudes. Participants in both groups showed increased amplitudes in the middle LPP window when they reappraised negative pictures compared to when they attended them. Only in the HC group, increased LPP amplitudes during reappraisal were paralleled by more positive affective responses. Limitation: The applied stimuli were part of picture databases and might therefore have limited self-relevance. Conclusions: Increased LPP amplitude during ER in both groups might be specific to adolescence and might suggest that ER at this age is challenging and requires a high amount of cognitive resources. These findings provide an important starting point for future interventional studies in youth MD. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Whilst most people have a right-handed preference, about 10% are left-handed. Similarly, the right eye is usually preferred to the left. Medicine is both taught and practiced for those with right hand and eye preference, and left-handed medicalstudents and doctorsmust negotiate the right-handed world. This brief review looks at society’s attitudes, medical training and the practice of otolaryngology in the United Kingdom (UK) towards laterality and handedness. Methods: Literature review. Results: Studies suggest that left-handers are more versatile and so are more ambidextrous. Conversely, this may result in problems when a right-hander tries to undertake a procedure with the non-dominant hand. Conclusions: Cultures and attitudes are changing towards those who are left-handed. Lefthanded surgeons may encounter difficultiesin the clinical environment throughout their training. © The Author(s), 2023.

They were divided into 2h/d occlusion group, 6h/d occlusion group and all-day occlusion group according to the duration of occlusion, with fine sight training of amblyopic eyes. The effect of the first dose (baseline visual acuity- first review visual acuity), cured visual acuity, stereo vision at the first review and cure time of amblyopic eyes were recorded. The factors affecting the first dose effect in patients with unilateral amblyopia were also analyzed. • RESULTS: All patients had a baseline visual acuity of 0.4 (0.22, 0.52), a first follow-up visual acuity of 0.22 (0.15, 0.3), a first-dose effect of 0.1 (0.08, 0.18), and a visual acuity of 0 (-0.08, 0.05) when amblyopia cured. The first-dose effects were 0.08 (0.07, 0.12) for patients in the 2h/d occlusion group, 0.18 (0.08, 0.3) for the 6h/d occlusion group, and 0.10 (0. 08, 0.18) for the all - day occlusion group. The most significant first-dose effect was the 6h/d occlusion group (P < 0. 05); Analysis of different influencing factors showed that the highest values of the first-dose effect of 6h/d occlusion were in the 3- 6 years group, 7 - 12 years group, female group, strabismic amblyopia group and mild to moderate group (P < 0.05); Furthermore, the first dose effect of the 6h/d occlusion was positively correlated with cure time of amblyopic eyes (rs = 0.334, P = 0.038). At the first follow - up, 21 cases (53.8%) had improved Titmus stereo visual acuity in the 6h/d occlusion group, which was higher than that in the 2h/d and all-day occlusion groups [16 cases (41.0%), 13 cases (22.8%), P<0.017]. •CONCLUSIONS: For monocular amblyopia, the first - dose effect of 6h/d occlusion treatment was the most significant, and the recovery of stereopsis was the best. © 2022 International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

They rely on the maintenance of slowly moving object on the fovea. While most of the studies evaluated tracking of a target that moves in the fronto-parallel plane, only two assessed vergence eye movements (VEM), which relies on the pursuit of object that moves in depth. The aim of our study was to compare VEM performance in SZ and BD. We evaluated 28 SZ patients, 32 BD patients and 25 healthy controls (HC). Participants underwent thorough optometric examination before eye tracking task. VEM were measured with the use of infrared eye tracker and dedicated vergence stimuli generator. SZ patients showed higher mean break and recovery points of fusion and shorter correct tracking time than HC. BD individuals revealed tracking accuracy deficits and higher number of saccades than HC. Compared to BD, SZ patients showed decrease of maximal convergence and divergence. Moreover, they presented tracking accuracy deficits of non-dominant eye: altered eyes positioning error during convergence and divergence gain. Exploratory analysis revealed significant gender differences between groups in terms of binocular VEM parameters. In this study we have recognized pattern of eye movement disturbances differentiating abovementioned groups. SZ patients showed decreased vergence tracking range with shorter tracking time and impaired accuracy of non-dominant eye, while BD patients showed higher number of saccades with decreased tracking accuracy. Neuroimaging studies are necessary to identify neuronal underpinnings of VEM impairments in SZ and BD. © 2022 The Authors
Phaf R.H.;0.0;Merging and modifying hypotheses on the emotional and cognitive effects of eye movements: The dopaminergic regulation hypothesis;2023;New Ideas in Psychology;10.1016/j.newideapsych.2023.101026;The integration of hypotheses from Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and Saccade Induced Retrieval Enhancement (SIRE), both of which have been met with considerable skepticism, may lead to significant gains in both domains. Cognitive accounts of EMDR, the orienting response (OR) and working memory (WM) hypotheses, and of SIRE, the interhemispheric interaction (IHI) and the top-down attentional control (TDAC) hypotheses, are discussed. The accounts show several blind spots and frictions, for instance, on re-imagining during EMs, on hemispheric lateralization, and on emotional influences of eye movements. The failure to consider these factors across and within domains may well explain the many disparate findings. This perspective aims to remove the artificial separation and seeks a theoretical integration of the domains. It combines elements of OR and TDAC into a new dopaminergic regulation hypothesis while replacing affective (i.e., positive vs. negative) by motivational mechanisms (i.e., fostering approach and recoding). EMs are posited to result in a short-latency, targeted release of dopamine, which is the central neuromodulator in approach tendencies. According to this hypothesis, the largest effects are obtained in individuals with collateralized eye dominance and dopamine dominance. Concrete suggestions are made to improve research conditions and therapeutic efficacy. © 2023

In sports, a player is deemed to adopt a “right- or left-handed” stance depending on the hand that is lower on the club or bat. Research has suggested there is an advantage in going against this convention by placing the preferred hand at the top in a “reversed-stance”. This study aimed to establish if the reversed-stance advantage exists in golf, whether it is underpinned by the preferred hand or dominant eye, and why players adopt such a stance. We tested hand preference, eye dominance, and full swing stance in 150 golfers (30 for each handicap category) and conducted follow-up interviews with 12 reversed-stance players. Professional or category 1 golfers were 21.5 times more likely to adopt a reversed-stance. The advantage could not be explained by ambidexterity or the dominant eye but could be explained by the position of the preferred hand. Reversed-stance players cited a variety of reasons for adopting it and were more likely to display a left-hand preference. Findings offer initial evidence of a reversed-stance advantage in golf and can inform work identifying its origins and mechanisms. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Choe E.; Kim M.-S.";0.0;Eye-specific attentional bias driven by selection history;2022;Psychonomic Bulletin and Review;10.3758/s13423-022-02121-0;Attention helps in selection among competing stimuli, but attentional selection also biases subsequent information processing as a prior experience. Previous studies have demonstrated that intertrial repetition of target features or locations facilitates perceptual processing as selection history guides attention. In the current study, we found that eye selection history in binocular rivalry induces eye-specific attentional bias. In four experiments, participants responded to the target presented at one of the locations on either eye. The results showed that the target was detected faster when presented to the same eye as in the previous trial under binocular rivalry. However, the effect of eye repetition was not observed when the interocular conflict was reduced by presenting stimuli to only one eye on each trial. Our result indicates that eye selection history can affect eye dominance during binocular rivalry as attention amplifies selected information among competing inputs. These findings suggest that prior experience of attentional deployment modulates subsequent information processing owing to the residual effect of attentional amplification. © 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

The reported prevalence is less than 1%, although likely underestimated due to the difficulties with diagnosis. The exact pathophysiology of SSONH remains elusive, but a mechanism involving developmental attrition of retinal ganglion cells has been proposed, and maternal diabetes is recognized as a major risk factor. SSONH often is observed incidentally, and the patients typically are then evaluated for an acquired optic atrophy, often glaucoma because of the presence of inferior visual field defects. There are 4 characteristic signs of SSONH: superior entrance of the central retinal artery, superior disc pallor, superior peripapillary halo, and thinning of the superior peripapillary nerve fiber layer; however, the presence of these signs is variable. Optical coherence tomography can be helpful in distinguishing SSONH by demonstrating superonasal retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, as compared to the inferotemporal thinning seen in glaucoma, and an aberrant extension of retinal pigment epithelium over Bruch membrane. Overall, the prognosis of SSONH is favorable, with a non-progressive course. It is essential that ophthalmologists recognize and differentiate SSONH from glaucoma to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

Methods: In this pilot prospective coherent study, 34 participants between 4 and 9 years of age with unilateral anisometropic amblyopia and without history of prior amblyopia treatment were enrolled into three groups. Full treatment group (FTG; n = 12): participants were prescribed the binocular dichoptic treatment to watch for 90 minutes per day, 5 days a week. Part-time treatment group (PTTG; n = 8): participants were prescribed the same binocular treatment as FTG, 90 minutes per day, 3 days per week. Patching treatment group (PTG; n = 14): participants wore an adhesive patch over the dominant eye for 2 hours per day, 7 days per week. Amblyopic-eye distance visual acuity (DVA), near visual acuity (NVA) and SA were evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: At 12 weeks, mean amblyopic-eye DVA improved 1.8 lines (95% CI, 1.1–2.5) in FTG, 1.5 lines (95% CI, 0.4–2.7) in PTTG and 3.0 lines (95% CI, 2.0–4.0) in PTG. The amblyopic-eye NVA improved 2.9 lines (95% CI, 2.4–3.5) in FTG, 1.7 lines (95% CI, 0.5–3.0) in PTTG and 2.8 lines (95% CI, 1.8–3.9) in PTG. The SA improved 0.38 log-arcseconds (95% CI, 0.24–0.53) in FTG, 0.59 log-arcseconds (95% CI, 0.36–0.82) in PTTG and 0.40 log-arcseconds (95% CI, 0.13–0.67) in PTG. No significant differences were found in DVA, NVA or SA improvement between FTG and PTG at 12 weeks. Conclusions: VA and SA after binocular dichoptic treatment produced a similar therapeutic outcome to patching, suggesting a potential value for binocular therapy when treating anisometropic moderate degree of Children’s amblyopia. © 2023 Taylor & Francis."
"Yu C.-Z.; Wu F.-G.";0.0;Influences of viewing angle, product position, and consumers’ physical characteristics on their Kansei images;2022;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0276421;"Changes in consumer behavior in recent years have led to a steady increase in the number of online shoppers. The viewing angle of a product and its position on a webpage can affect consumers’ Kansei images and purchase intentions. This study aimed to determine the influences of product viewing angle and position on a webpage on consumers’ Kansei images; the influences of consumers’ physical characteristics (i.e., sex, dominant hand, and dominant eye) on their Kansei images were also explored. An experiment was designed to evaluate the influences of viewing angle and position on consumers’ Kansei images. A product’s viewing angle and position on the webpage in question served as independent variables, and the participants’ Kansei images served as the dependent variable. Seven representative viewing angles were selected. A predetermined product was placed in nine positions in a 3×3 grid on a webpage. A total of 63 combinations were obtained, and an experiment and interview were designed to investigate the participants’ Kansei images for all 63. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Viewing angle affected the participants’ Kansei images; 2. the position of the product on the webpage affected the participants’ Kansei images; and 3. some physical characteristics affected the participants’ Kansei images. In summary, online marketing platforms could document shoppers’ physical characteristics to provide them with personalized product displays in order to cater to their Kansei images preferences. These research findings could be applied to online shopping platforms, which could attract more diverse groups of clients by adjusting product display angles and product positions on webpages based on consumers’ physical characteristics and preferences. © 2022 Yu, Wu.

"Acquafredda M.; Binda P.; Lunghi C.";0.0;Attention Cueing in Rivalry: Insights from Pupillometry;2022;eNeuro;10.1523/ENEURO.0497-21.2022;"We used pupillometry to evaluate the effects of attention cueing on perceptual bi-stability, as reported by adult human observers. Perceptual alternations and pupil diameter were measured during two forms of rivalry, generated by presenting a white and a black disk to the two eyes (binocular rivalry) or splitting the disks between eyes (interocular grouping rivalry). In line with previous studies, we found that subtle pupil size modulations (;0.05 mm) tracked alternations between exclusive dominance phases of the black or white disk. These pupil responses were larger for perceptually stronger stimuli: presented to the dominant eye or with physically higher luminance contrast. However, cueing of endogenous attention to one of the rivaling percepts did not affect pupil modulations during exclusive dominance phases. This was observed despite the reliable effects of endogenous attention on perceptual dominance, which shifted in favor of the cued percept by ;10%. The results were comparable for binocular and interocular grouping rivalry. Cueing only had a marginal modulatory effect on pupil size during mixed percepts in binocular rivalry. This may suggest that, rather than acting by modulating perceptual strength, endogenous attention primarily acts during periods of unresolved competition, which is compatible with attention being automatically directed to the rivaling stimuli during periods of exclusive dominance and thereby sustaining perceptual alternations. © 2022, Society for Neuroscience.

"Dai M.; Huang X.; Chen Z.; Tai Y.; Shi J.";0.0;"Experimental Research on Binocular Hue Cancellation Phenomenon; [双 目 色 调 消 除 现 象 的 实 验 研 究]";2023;Guangxue Xuebao/Acta Optica Sinica;10.3788/AOS222149;Objective The application of stereoscopic display, virtual reality, and head-mounted devices requires research on binocular properties of the human vision system (HVS). Threshold measurement is one method to investigate the characteristics of visual perception. At the same time, there are some color vision phenomena related to binocular vision systems that cannot be explained. One of the phenomena is called hue cancellation, which can also occur in binocular vision. Thus, it is called binocular hue cancellation and is a special phenomenon in binocular color fusion. Currently, most studies on binocular color fusion focus on the reproduction of glossiness in binocular color fusion, quantitative measurement of the thresholds of binocular color fusion, and the distinction between binocular color fusion and rivalry. However, as far as we know, no particular studies on binocular hue cancellation have been reported. To investigate the color vision mechanism of this particular phenomenon, we design a psychophysical experiment. We also investigate the opposite color directions and hue cancellation thresholds within the binocular color fusion that can perceive gray in the CIELAB color space and represent the experimental results in the LMS, Macleod-Boynton, and DKL color spaces respectively to provide experimental data for exploring the visual properties of HVS and the mechanism of binocular color. Methods We research a Samsung 3D display (S23A950D) with 2D/3D switching capability, requiring the observer to wear specific 3D switching glasses to obtain binocular vision. Eight opposite color directions are selected at 22. 5° intervals in the isoluminance plane of CIELAB color space, and color stimulus sample pairs are selected at equal intervals in each direction (Fig. 4). The experiment is conducted among five college students between the ages of 22 and 25 with normal vision, and each of them experiences at least 19800 color stimuli. We carry out the experiment in a dark room and first employ the adjustment method to determine the opposite color directions in which the binocular hue cancellation phenomenon could occur and the initial values of the binocular hue cancellation thresholds. Then the limit method is adopted to accurately determine the binocular hue cancellation thresholds. Results and Discussions The experimental results show that binocular hue cancellation phenomenon could occur only when red-green (R-G), yellow-blue (Y-B), and yellow green-purple (YG-P) color pairs are combined (Fig. 6). The binocular hue cancellation thresholds of the five observers are expressed in the CIELAB, LMS, Macleod-Boynton, and DKL color spaces respectively. In the CIELAB color space, the range of binocular hue cancellation thresholds in the R-G color direction is 11. 36-13. 58, with a mean value of 13. 03, and the range of thresholds in the Y-B direction is 8.14-10.07, with a mean value of 9. 25. The range of thresholds in the YG-P direction is 11. 26-15. 55, with a mean value of 13. 02. Among them, the Y-B combination has the smallest threshold, and the average thresholds of the R-G and YG-P combinations are almost equal (Table 2). After exchanging the colors viewed by the left and right eyes, the obtained binocular hue cancellation thresholds are similar, which indicates that the dominant eye does not affect the binocular hue cancellation phenomenon. Five observers are largely different in thresholds of the YG-P direction, and one of them has much smaller thresholds in the R-G direction than the others, showing individual differences in the binocular hue cancellation phenomenon (Fig. 7). In the LMS color space, the six color directions are uniformly distributed and almost divide the L-M plane into six equal parts. The color directions in the L-M plane and the L-S plane are symmetric about the S axis, and the thresholds in the L-M plane are shown as a straight line parallel to the S axis (Fig. 8). In the Macleod-Boynton chromaticity diagram, the binocular hue cancellation thresholds of six colors are close to the white point, indicating the saturation of the colors which can produce the binocular hue cancellation phenomenon is low (Fig. 9). In DKL space, the direction of YG-P overlaps with the cardinal direction S- (L+M), while the directions of R-G, Y-B, and the cardinal direction L-M are not close to each other (Fig. 10). Conclusions The binocular hue cancellation phenomenon is investigated through a visual psychophysics experimental method. The results show that the particular phenomenon can only occur in three color directions of red-green, yellow-blue, and yellow green-purple, which means observers can only perceive gray in the three directions. There are individual differences in binocular hue cancellation thresholds of the five observers, but the thresholds in the yellow-blue direction are all minimal. Because the study on visual mechanisms is strongly related to the choice of color space, the binocular hue cancellation thresholds of the five observers are expressed in the color spaces of CIELAB, LMS, Macleod-Boynton, and DKL respectively. The binocular hue cancellation directions are more uniformly distributed in LMS, Macleod-Boynton, and DKL color space approximately in six equal parts, implying the specificity of these six hues. The binocular hue cancellation threshold occupies only a small range in Macleod-Boynton color space, thus indicating that the binocular hue cancellation phenomenon not only occurs in the three color directions but also occupies only a small range within the color range that can be perceived by the human visual system. © 2023 Chinese Optical Society.

Mather D.S.;0.0;Preventing Children From Developing Dyslexia: A Premature Writing Hypothesis;2022;Perceptual and Motor Skills;10.1177/00315125221075001;It has been argued that dyslexia may develop in strongly left eye dominant children through learning to write using ipsilateral, right hemisphere motor pathways. New light on this theory has been cast by recent findings of atypical enhanced corpus callosum white matter in children with dyslexia, reflecting right to left hemisphere communication that is resistant to intensive remedial reading intervention. Enhanced corpus callosum white matter is consistent with uninhibited right to left hemisphere ipsilateral mirror-motor innervation, manifested as frequent mirror-letter writing errors in children with dyslexia. Delaying writing instruction until 7–8 years of age may prevent these errors and as well as the development of dyslexia. During the 7–8-year age period, visual-proprioceptive integration enables a child to mentally map whole word visual images onto kinesthetic/proprioceptive letter engrams (memory representations). Hypothetically, this process is facilitated by anterior commissure activity involving interhemispheric transfer of ipsilateral mirror-to-non mirror-motor movement. This postulate, involving delayed writing instruction pending further maturation, also receives indirect support from the remarkable proficiency leap among second graders reading Hebrew as Hebrew involves a leftward orthography in which ipsilateral right to left hemisphere innervation is uninhibited. Additionally, and more directly, normal reading comprehension for learning English among children with agenesis of the corpus callosum suggests that letter-sound decoding is not the sole route to proficient reading comprehension. In this paper, I make recommendations for obtaining empirical evidence of premature writing as a cause of dyslexia. © The Author(s) 2022.
Innocenti G.M.;0.0;Defining neuroplasticity;2022;Handbook of Clinical Neurology;10.1016/B978-0-12-819410-2.00001-1;"Neuroplasticity, i.e., the modifiability of the brain, is different in development and adulthood. The first includes changes in: (i) neurogenesis and control of neuron number; (ii) neuronal migration; (iii) differentiation of the somato-dendritic and axonal phenotypes; (iv) formation of connections; (v) cytoarchitectonic differentiation. These changes are often interrelated and can lead to: (vi) system-wide modifications of brain structure as well as to (vii) acquisition of specific functions such as ocular dominance or language. Myelination appears to be plastic both in development and adulthood, at least, in rodents. Adult neuroplasticity is limited, and is mainly expressed as changes in the strength of excitatory and inhibitory synapses while the attempts to regenerate connections have met with limited success. The outcomes of neuroplasticity are not necessarily adaptive, but can also be the cause of neurological and psychiatric pathologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

Materials and methods: A total of 82 mentally healthy subjects were assessed with a Combined Foot and Eye Dominance Scale. The Foot Dominance Subscale included a modified Chapman Chapman Foot Dominance scale and a new Complex Tasks scale with four foot tests reflecting more complex tasks. The Eye Dominance Subscale included three eye tests. Scale reliability statistics (item-scale statistics, summary statistics for the items, Cronbach's alpha), nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were used. Results: Considerable differences were found in the contribution of the single items to the Combined Scale. The means of some items were 37.83 times greater than those of other items (from 0.15 to 5.61), which suggested greater phenogenetic component and consequently greater contribution of these items to the total scale mean. The mean correlation between the items of the Combined Foot and Eye Dominance Scale was strongly positive (0.39), indicating good internal consistency of the scale. Conclusions: Eye and foot dominance appear to be a much subtler indicator of altered hemispheric lateralization than hand dominance. The Combined Dominance Scale provides a more adequate tool for objective measuring of leftedness, as a way to assess laterality, since this scale is to a great degree unaffected by socio-cultural impact. The scale would provide comparability of leftedness as an indirect clue of abnormal lateralization in studies of mentally healthy subjects and subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders with presumed abnormal cerebral asymmetry across cultures.  © 2023 K.

We previously reported shorter hand reaction times for targets appearing in the contralateral visual hemifield with respect to the dominant eye (DE). Here, we further explore this contralateral bias by studying the influence of laterally placed visual distractors on vertical saccade trajectories, a sensitive method to assess visual processing. In binocular conditions, saccade trajectory curvature was larger toward a distractor placed in the contralateral hemifield with respect to the DE (e.g., in the left visual hemifield for a participant with a right dominant eye) than toward one presented in the ipsilateral hemifield (in the right visual hemifield in our example). When two distractors were present at the same time, the vertical saccade showed curvature toward the contralateral side. In monocular conditions, when one distractor was presented, a similar larger influence of the contralateral distractor was observed only when the viewing eye was the DE. When the non dominant eye (NDE) was viewing, curvature was symmetric for both distractor sides. Interestingly, this curvature was as large as the one obtained for the contralateral distractor when the DE was viewing, suggesting that eye dominance consequences rely on inhibition mechanisms present when the DE is viewing. Overall, these results demonstrate that DE influences visual integration occurring around saccade production and support a DE-based contralateral visual bias. © 2022, The Author(s).

Nystagmus, if present in parkinsonian syndrome, suggests cerebellar involvement that is typical of multiple system atrophy. We found vertical jerky oscillations of the eyes during oculographic assessments using head-fixed corneal curvature trackers in six patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. The oscillations were eliminated by adequate head stabilization of the patients. Although this phenomenon gave the initial impression of “downbeat nystagmus”, the oscillations were phase locked and frequency matched with subtle jerky head oscillations. We interpreted such jerky eye oscillations as “pseudonystagmus” representing the vestibulo-ocular reflex in response to involuntary subtle jerky head oscillations in our patients. This study further emphasizes the importance of head stabilization during instrumented or clinical assessment of gaze holding. © 2022
"Jiang R.; Meng M.";0.0;Integration and suppression interact in binocular vision;2023;Journal of vision;10.1167/jov.23.10.17;Contingent on stereo compatibility, two images presented dichoptically can lead to either binocular integration, thus generating stable stereopsis, or interocular suppression that induces binocular rivalry with bistable perception that alternates between the two images. The relationship between binocular integration and interocular suppression concerns how our brain processes binocular inputs to form unified visual awareness but remains unclear. Here, a series of psychophysical experiments were conducted to address this question, revealing that these collaborative and competitive binocular interactions are interconnected and would mediate one another according to their strength. Specifically, Experiments 1a and 1b showed that the presence of binocular rivalry inhibited peripheral stereopsis, significantly elevating the stereo threshold, with higher elevation resulting from increasing rivalry contrast. Experiments 2a and 2b showed that existing stereopsis with increasing binocular disparity balanced the dynamics of peripheral binocular rivalry, rendering more equivalent eye dominance. Based on these interactions, we suggest that binocular integration and interocular suppression may mediate one another through an overlapping mechanism for regulating eye dominance, with strong stereo percepts tending to reduce eye dominance and strong rivalry tending to increase eye dominance.

Methods: The spectrophotometric retinal oximetry and colour Doppler imaging (CDI) of retinal vessels were successfully performed with 52 healthy subjects (average age 29.7 ± 5.6 years). The retinal oximeter simultaneously measures the wavelength difference of haemoglobin oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and venules. The arteriolar and venular saturation in both eyes was measured. The peak systolic (PSV) end diastolic (EDV) velocities, resistive (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indices were obtained for both eyes using CDI in the ophthalmic artery. A paired t-test and two sample t-tests were used for statistical analyses. The correlation was assessed using the Pearson coefficient correlation. Results: The mean oxygen saturation level was 96.9 ± 3.0% for the retinal arterioles and 65.0 ± 5.1% for the retinal venules. The A-V difference was 31.8 ± 4.6%. The mean of the measured haemodynamic parameters was PSV 46.6 ± 9.4 cm/s, EDV 12.0 ± 3.5 cm/s, PI 1.68 ± 0.38 and RI 0.74 ± 0.05. No significant difference in oxygen saturation and haemodynamic parameters was found between the left and the right eyes or the dominant and non-dominant eye. The oximetry and ultrasound values were sex independent. The Pearson correlation coefficient demonstrated a significant yet weak negative correlation between A-V difference and RI (r = −0.321, p = 0.020). Conclusions: A negative correlation between A-V difference and resistance index was observed, suggesting that reduced oxygen consumption may reflect the increased vascular tone of the ophthalmic vessels, which is likely determined by autoregulatory mechanisms. © 2022 The Authors.

Severe (“classic”) and milder (“variant”) forms of the disease exist, depending on whether the mutation in the A-T Mutated (ATM) gene results in complete absence or reduced levels of functioning ATM protein, respectively. Onset of neurological features in classic A-T usually occurs in the preschool years. While cerebellar ataxia is usually present, other extrapyramidal motor features are sometimes dominant.

However, little is known about the effect of monocular pattern deprivation on contrast sensitivity (CS) and its corresponding mechanisms. Here, contrast sensitivity function (CSF) in the nondominant eye of normal subjects was evaluated before and after 150 min of monocular pattern deprivation. To obtain a CSF with high precision and efficiency before deprivation effect washout, a quick CSF (qCSF) method was used to assess CS over a wide range of spatial frequencies and at two external noise levels. We found that (1) monocular pattern deprivation effectively improved the CS of the deprived eye with larger effect on high spatial frequencies, (2) CS improvement only occurred when external noise was absent and its amount was spatial frequency dependent, and (3) a perceptual template model (PTM) revealed that decreased internal additive noise accounted for the mechanism of the monocular pattern derivation effect. These findings help us better understand the features of short-term monocular pattern deprivation and shed light on the treatment of amblyopia.

In the present study, we examined (a) howcultural familiarity influences multisensory emotion perception in Eastern and Western cultures and (b) the underlying processes accounting for the cultural difference in modality dominance. Method: Native Mandarin speakers from China and native English speakers from the United States were presented with audiovisual emotional stimuli from their own culture (i.e., familiar) and from a different culture (i.e., unfamiliar) and asked to evaluate the emotion from one of the two modalities. Across modalities, the emotions were either the same (i.e., congruent, happy face, and happy voice) or different (i.e., incongruent, happy face, and sad voice). Results: When the input was in a familiar cultural context,American participants were more influenced by the visual modality, while Chinese participants were more influenced by the auditory modality. While both groups integrated the incongruent emotion from the irrelevant modality, only the American group integrated the congruent emotion from the irrelevant modality. When the input was in a less familiar cultural context, both groups showed increased visual dominance, but only the Chinese group simultaneously showed decreased auditory dominance.

However, the possible mechanisms underlying monocular deprivation-induced perceptual eye dominance plasticity remain unclear. Using a binocular phase and contrast co-measurement task and a multi-pathway contrast-gain control model (MCM), we studied the effect of 150 min of monocular pattern deprivation (MPD) in normal adult subjects. The perceived phase and contrast varied significantly with the interocular contrast ratio, and after MPD, the patched eye (PE) became dominant. Most importantly, we focused on the potential mechanisms of the deprivation effect. The data of an averaged subject was best fitted by a model, which assumed a monocular signal enhancement of the PE after the MPD. The present findings might have important implications for investigations of binocular vision in both normal and amblyopic populations. Copyright © 2022 Tao, Yang, Li, Cheng, Li, Huang, Wu and Zhang.

Yet, how short-term monocular deprivation modulates sensory eye dominance across spatial frequency is not clear. To address this issue, we conducted a study to investigate the dependence of short-term monocular deprivation effect on test spatial frequency. Methods: Ten healthy young adults (age: 24.7 ± 1.7 years, four males) with normal vision participated. We deprived their dominant eye with a translucent patch for 2.5 h. The interocular contrast ratio (dominant eye/non-dominant eye, i.e., the balance point [BP]), which indicates the contribution that the two eyes make to binocular combination, was measured using a binocular orientation combination task. We assessed if BPs at 0.5, 4 or 6 cycles/degree (c/d) change as a result of monocular deprivation. Different test spatial frequency conditions were conducted on three separate days in a random fashion. Results: We compared the BPs at 0.5, 4 and 6 c/d before and after monocular deprivation. The BPs were found to be significantly affected by deprivation, where sensory eye dominance shift to the deprived eye (F1.86, 16.76 = 33.09, P < 0.001). The changes of BP were consistent at 0.5, 4, and 6 c/d spatial frequencies (F2,18 = 0.15, P = 0.57). Conclusion: The sensory eye dominance plasticity induced by short-term deprivation is not dependent on test spatial frequency, suggesting it could provide a practical solution for amblyopic therapy that was concerned with the binocular outcome. © 2022, The Author(s).

For this purpose, a retrospective study analysis of data of 161 children (4–13 years) who underwent dichoptic treatment with the Bynocs® platform (Kanohi Eye Pvt. Ltd., India) was performed. In all cases, the therapy protocol consisted of sessions of training of 30 min daily 5 times a week for 6 weeks. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the non‐dominant eye improved significantly with the treatment, with a mean change of 0.39 logMAR in the whole sample (p < 0.001). Regarding binocularity, the binocular function (BF) score also experienced a significant improvement (p < 0.001), with a mean change of 1.55 with therapy in the whole sample. The BCVA of the dominant eye only improved significantly (p < 0.001) in the isometropic amblyopic subgroup.

In these large-scale replication projects, replication has typically been evaluated based on a single replication study of some original study and dichotomously as successful or failed. However, evaluations of replicability that are based on a single study and are dichotomous are inadequate, and evaluations of replicability should instead be based on multiple studies, be continuous, and be multi-faceted. Further, such evaluations are in fact possible due to two characteristics shared by many large-scale replication projects. In this article, we provide such an evaluation for two prominent large-scale replication projects, one which replicated a phenomenon from cognitive psychology and another which replicated 13 phenomena from social psychology and behavioral economics. Our results indicate a very high degree of replicability in the former and a medium to low degree of replicability in the latter. They also suggest an unidentified covariate in each, namely ocular dominance in the former and political ideology in the latter, that is theoretically pertinent. We conclude by discussing evaluations of replicability at large, recommendations for future large-scale replication projects, and design-based model generalization.

In total, 53 patients (30 males and 23 females) were involved, and the mean age was 25.62 ± 2.41 (age range: 23–36). The dominant eye was treated with tropicamide + phenylephrine (Visumidriatic Fenil 100 mg/mL + 5 mg/mL, Visufarma) while the nondominant eye was used as the control. An OCT analysis was performed on both eyes before and 30 min after the instillation of a drop of mydriatic in the dominant eye. The ChT was measured by using the OCT software measurement tool (Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering; Heidelberg, Germany, version 6.0). The results showed a statistically significant ChT decrease (p = 0.009) in the temporal sector after the treatment with tropicamide + phenylephrine. In the subfoveal and nasal sectors, no statistically significant ChT changes were detected (p = 0.94; p = 0.85) following the administration of the mydriatic eye drops. The ChT thinning in the temporal sector following the instillation of the tropicamide + phenylephrine eye drops suggests that in the case of ChT studies, mydriatic administration should be avoided. © 2023 by the authors."
"Min S.H.; Mao Y.; Chen S.; Hess R.F.; Zhou J.";0.0;Modulation of mean luminance improves binocular balance across spatial frequencies in amblyopia;2022;iScience;10.1016/j.isci.2022.104598;Amblyopia is a visual impairment that perturbs binocular balance at high spatial frequencies in favor of the fellow eye. Studies reveal that amblyopes who had been treated with monocular therapies still show imbalance. Binocular balance is achieved when both eyes’ inputs are weighed equally. A reduced light can diminish the dimmed eye's weight in binocular combination. In this study, we examined if binocular balance across spatial frequencies could be improved by reducing the luminance of the fellow eye in adult amblyopes. By doing so, we relieved their binocular imbalance across spatial frequencies. Also, normal observers showed amblyopic binocular imbalance when the dominant eye's light level was dimmed. Therefore, reducing the luminance in the unaffected eye in amblyopia mitigated the binocular imbalance, whereas doing so in normal adults simulated the amblyopic imbalance across spatial frequencies. © 2022 The Authors

Methods: This is an interventional case series. The seven cases were put on a trial frame containing subjective refraction, fogging plus lenses for the dominant eye, correcting prism, and anaglyphic red-cyan plastic spectacles. Patients participated in 20 sessions of 1.5 h of anaglyphic three-dimensional animated movie watching in the office. Significant visual acuity (VA) improvement was defined as improvement ≥0.2 in logMAR values. Change in octaves of stereopsis was defined as halving the arcsec or 0.3 change in log arcsec. Results: The average age was 26.9 ± 10.0 (16-42) years. The mean VA in amblyopic eye improved significantly from 0.42 ± 0.19 (0.15-0.7) logMAR to 0.25 ± 0.15 (0.1-0.5) logMAR after completion of sessions (P = 0.02), and four cases showed significant VA improvement. The mean stereoacuity improved significantly from 2.6 ± 0.3 (2.1-2.9) log arcsec to 2.1 ± 0.5 (1.7-2.9) log arcsec (P = 0.04). Four cases showed ≥2 octaves improvements in stereopsis.

Here, we tested whether other types of MSI – evoked by asynchronous yet temporally flanking irrelevant stimuli – result in similar performance patterns. To this end, we presented sequences of 12 stimuli (10 Hz) which consisted of auditory (A), visual (V) or alternating auditory-visual stimuli (e.g. A-V-A-V-…) with either auditory or visual targets (Exp. 1). Participants discriminated target frequencies (auditory pitch or visual spatial frequency) embedded in these sequences. To test effects of TE, the proportion of early and late temporal target positions was manipulated run-wise. Performance for unisensory targets was affected by temporally flanking distractors, with auditory temporal flankers selectively improving visual target perception (Exp. 1). However, no effect of temporal expectation was observed. Control experiments (Exp. 2–3) tested whether this lack of TE effect was due to the higher presentation frequency in Exp. 1 relative to previous experiments. Importantly, even at higher stimulation frequencies redundant multisensory targets (Exp. 2–3) reliably modulated TEs. Together, our results indicate that visual target detection was enhanced by MSI. However, this cross-modal enhancement – in contrast to the redundant target effect – was still insufficient to generate TEs. We posit that unisensory target representations were either instable or insufficient for the generation of TEs while less demanding MSI still occurred; highlighting the need for robust stimulus representations when generating temporal expectations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Minimal visual errors could be related to performance losses. However, not all visual skills have been studied in depth in this sport. The main objectives of this study were to compare differences in shooters’ visual skills by level and to analyze the competition effect on them. Sixty-six participants were distributed in three groups (non-athletes, elite and non-elite). Eleven visual variables were tested in four skills groups (visual acuity, heterophoria, accommodation functions and other visual skills). The data were collected through a pre- and post-competition simulation test. The results of the study showed differences between groups by shooting sport level. In general, shooters had higher visual acuity values than non-athletes p <.001 with large size effects (d between 1.01 and 2.35), and elite shooters presented higher values of accommodation than non-elite shooters p <.05 with large size effects (d between 0.88 and 0.97). Furthermore, different visual skills were modified after competition depending on the shooting level. Specifically, visual accommodation skills were only improved in elite shooters. Finally, our study suggests that elite shooters employ different visual strategies or skills to non-elite shooters and that shooting activity is closely related to some specific visual skills. This aspect should be considered by coaches in the design of optimal visual trainings and improve the shooters’ performance. Highlights Shooters showed better acuity skills than non-athletes. Shooting activity seems to improve visual acuity skills, binocular visual time and eye–hand coordination in non-elite shooters, and accommodation and eye–hand coordination in elite shooters immediately after the competition simulation. Elite shooters employ different visual strategies or skills to non-elite shooters. Non-dominant eye occlusion may benefit binocular vision recovery by inhibiting aiming action and the use of accommodative flexibility could be related to the QE during the shot. © 2021 European College of Sport Science.

Subjects and methods: Three tests for eye dominance were administered as performance tasks, not preference questionnaires. Seven MPAs were examined. The sample consisted of 180 (98 schizophrenia patients and 82 control subjects). Several statistical methods for examining the eye tests separately and together were used to assess the difference in left-eyedness between schizophrenia patients and control subjects. Results: Left eye dominance is significantly higher in schizophrenia subjects. Left-eyed subjects are more stigmatized with MPAs. There is a strong positive correlation between left-eyedness and stigmatization with MPAs in schizophrenia patients. Conclusion: As hand dominance is under cultural pressure, eye dominance is culturally independent and is useful and reliable indicator of altered hemispheric lateralization. The significant positive correlations between left-eyedness and MPAs and the high concurrence of these biological markers in schizophrenia patients are a potent indicator of underlying aberrant neurodevelopment.

METHODS: This prospective study included 158 children with anisometropic amblyopia who were admitted to the hospital between February 2018 and September 2020. Children enrolled were divided into penalization therapy group (78 cases) and occlusion therapy group (80 cases) by random number table method. Dominant eyes of the penalization therapy group were treated with 1% atropine gel for twice a week, while dominant eyes of the occlusion therapy group were covered for 2h or longer every day. Treatment effect, stereoscopic function and contrast sensitivity were measured after 6mo of treatment. The pattern visual evoked potentials were detected, treatment compliance, and treatment effect were evaluated. RESULTS: The overall compliance rates of the penalization therapy group and the occlusion therapy group were 96.2% and 73.8% (P< 0.05). The overall response rates of the two groups were 79.5% and 73.8% (P> 0.05). The overall effective rates of stereoscopic visual function reconstruction in the two groups were 74.4% and 56.3% (P< 0.05). After treatment, the contrast sensitivities under 1, 4, 8, 10 and 12c/d were significantly increased in the two groups (all P< 0.001). Besides, the contrast sensitivities under 8, 10 and 12c/d in the penalization therapy group were higher than those in the occlusion therapy group (all P< 0.05). After treatment, P100 amplitude (μV)of the penalization therapy group was higher than that of the occlusion therapy group (12.96±2.10 vs 11.42±2.53μV, P< 0.05), while P100 latency (ms) was lower than that of the occlusion therapy group (105.26±12.41 vs 111.40±11.74ms, P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with amblyopia, atropine penalization therapy can improve treatment compliance and stereoscopic visual function of patients with amblyopia, and have higher safety.

The aim of this study was to assess the value of optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) for the diagnosis of RM in patients with choroidal melanoma treated with PBT. Materials & methods: This 2-year prospective, descriptive, single-center study included patients treated with PBT for choroidal melanoma. VA measurement, retinography, OCT and OCT-A were performed. Vascular density (VD) in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), peri-foveal anastomotic ring changes and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) enlargement were studied. Results: Nineteen patients were included in the study. The median baseline melanoma thickness was 5.7 [3.6–8.1] mm. The median melanoma-to-macula distance was 3.5 [2.6–4.6] mm. The earliest signs of RM identified on retinography were hard exudates developing at 12 [12–24] months, followed by retinal hemorrhages at 18 [12–30] months, found in 88.9% and 77.8% of patients respectively. On OCT, the earliest sign was the onset/progression of cystoid macular edema (CME) at 12 [6–12] months, found in 10 patients (52.6%). On OCT-A, 100% of patients presented with a discontinuity of the perifoveal anastomotic ring and a FAZ enlargement after 12 [6–24] months. After 12 months, a VD loss in the SCP by 11.7% and 10.8% compared to baseline, was found in the macular and foveal areas respectively. A significant negative correlation was found between the VA and the VD in the macular SCP (R = −0.43; p = 0.029). Conclusion: OCT-A is a reliable and effective diagnostic tool for RM in patients with choroidal melanoma treated with PBT. © The Author(s) 2021."

A right- or left-facing arrowhead was presented as a central stimulus at the central vision, and participants were instructed to press a key only when the direction in which the arrowhead faced was a target. In a small number of trials, arrowheads that were facing in the same or opposite direction (flanker stimuli) were presented beside the central stimulus binocularly or monocularly as an AR image. In the binocular condition, the flanker stimuli were presented to both eyes, and, in the monocular condition, only to the dominant eye. The results revealed that participants could respond faster in the binocular condition than in the monocular one; however, only when the flanker stimuli were in the opposite direction was the response faster in the monocular condition. Moreover, the results of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) showed that all stimuli were processed in both the monocular and the binocular conditions in the perceptual stage; however, the influence of the flanker stimuli was attenuated in the monocular condition in the cognitive stage. The influence of flanker stimuli might be more unstable in the monocular condition than in the binocular condition, but more precise examination should be conducted in a future study. © 2021, The Author(s)."

In addition, we tried to catch any trend of ocular dominance according to the stage of disease. Methods: Two hundred participants with bilateral open-angle glaucoma underwent ocular dominant testing by “the hole-in-a-card” test. Using optical coherence tomography, macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, as well as circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness were measured and compared according to ocular dominance. Of the two eyes of one subject, the eye with less glaucomatous damage based on mean deviation was considered to be the “better eye” in our study. Results: Ocular dominance was in the right eye in 66% of the population and ocular dominance was positioned in the better eye in 70% of the population (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). In conditional logistic regression analyses, right eye and better mean deviation were significantly associated with ocular dominance (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Ocular dominance tends to be present in the better eye and this trend was more apparent as the severity of glaucoma increased. Intereye comparison of visual field indices and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness between dominant versus nondominant eye become apparent in moderate and advanced glaucoma whereas it was not as apparent in early glaucoma. Conclusions: In glaucomatous eyes, laterality and severity of glaucoma determined ocular dominance. Intereye difference between nondominant and dominant eyes increased with the severity of glaucoma. Our findings suggest the existence of potential reciprocal interactions between ocular dominance and glaucoma. © 2022 The Korean Ophthalmological Society
"Song F.; Lyu L.; Zhao J.; Bao M.";0.0;The role of eye-specific attention in ocular dominance plasticity;2023;Cerebral Cortex;10.1093/cercor/bhac116;It is well known how selective attention biases information processing in real time, but few work investigates the aftereffects of prolonged attention, let alone the underlying neural mechanisms. To examine perceptual aftereffect after prolonged attention to a monocular pathway, movie images played normally were presented to normal adult's one eye (attended eye), while movie images of the same episode but played backwards were presented to the opposite eye (unattended eye). One hour of watching this dichoptic movie caused a shift of perceptual ocular dominance towards the unattended eye. Interestingly, the aftereffect positively correlated with the advantage of neural activity for the attended-eye over unattended-eye signals at the frontal electrodes measured with steady-state visual evoked potentials. Moreover, the aftereffect disappeared when interocular competition was minimized during adaptation. These results suggest that top-down eye-specific attention can induce ocular dominance plasticity through binocular rivalry mechanisms. The present study opens the route to explain at least part of short-Term ocular dominance plasticity with the ocular-opponency-neuron model, which may be an interesting complement to the homeostatic compensation theory. © 2022 The Author(s).

Its links with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders prompted studies aimed at understanding the underlying genetics, while other measures and side preferences have been less studied. We investigated the heritability of hand, as well as foot, and eye preference by assessing parental effects (n ≤ 5028 family trios) and SNP-based heritability (SNP-h2, n ≤ 5931 children) in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). An independent twin cohort from Hong Kong (n = 358) was used to replicate results from structural equation modelling (SEM). Parental left-side preference increased the chance of an individual to be left-sided for the same trait, with stronger maternal than paternal effects for footedness. By regressing out the effects of sex, age, and ancestry, we transformed laterality categories into quantitative measures. The SNP-h2 for quantitative handedness and footedness was 0.21 and 0.23, respectively, which is higher than the SNP-h2 reported in larger genetic studies using binary handedness measures. The heritability of the quantitative measure of handedness increased (0.45) compared to a binary measure for writing hand (0.27) in the Hong Kong twins. Genomic and behavioural SEM identified a shared genetic factor contributing to handedness, footedness, and eyedness, but no independent effects on individual phenotypes. Our analysis demonstrates how quantitative multidimensional laterality phenotypes are better suited to capture the underlying genetics than binary traits. © 2022, The Author(s).

However, real-world issues (e.g. racial hierarchies) are recreated within digital spaces and influence inter- and intra-racial dating intentions. The study explored how users actualise the affordances of a mobile dating application like Tinder to fulfil their racialized dating intentions. Through a qualitative study based on 25 semi-structured interviews, four novel propositions are formulated. The study specifically contributes to affordance theory as well as theories around self-presentation, impression formation and preference disclosure. The propositions articulate how inter- and intra- racial dating intentions are supported when mediated by the actualisation of mobile dating applications affordances namely Visual Dominance, Synchronicity and Locatability. The study also bridges a gap in mobile dating literature by focusing on a context beyond the Global North context, namely South Africa. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Whereas structural models clarify the functional asymmetry due to direct access to local language circuits, dynamic models propose functional states of intrahemispheric activation and interhemispheric inhibition that are coupled with attentional processes. Real word settings often require modulations of lateralised neural processing and further express individual heterogeneity. In this research, we tested left- and right-handers, and used a behavioural paradigm with presentation of lateralised cue-target pairs to the same or opposite visual field. We observed that handedness distinctly affected word processing in the left hemisphere following contralateral cueing. Moreover, left-hemispheric dominance strengthened for right-handers vs abolished for left-handers, influencing behavioural efficiency. In combination with eye dominance recordings, these data suggest that attentional biases guided the processing strategies of both groups and in turn their achievements. Therefore, hand and eye dominance are both essential factors with a functional role in directing the communication of visual information between both hemispheres. Overall, the findings underline the importance of interacting hand-eye control systems in contributing to interhemispheric patterns in the context of language processing. © 2022 The Author(s)

All participants were subjected to comprehensive ophthalmic examination including vision, refraction, Intraocular pressure measurements, slit-lamp examination, the dominance of eye is determined using the hole in the card method and Accommodative functions like the Monocular estimated method (MEM), Near the point of accommodation (NPA) and Accommodative facility (AF) done to find out the ocular dominance. Result: This study shows a higher level of accommodative function in all aspects of accommodative factor such as Monocular estimated method (MEM), near the point of accommodation (NPA) and accommodative facility in the dominant eye. The Mean and Standard deviation value shows a significant difference in all parameters in the dominant eye with a t-value of 7.055(p=.000) when comparing with the Non dominant eye. Conclusion: Comparing the accommodative function between the Dominant and Non dominant eye we concluded that the Near Point of accommodation and accommodation facility were observed more in the dominant eye as compared with the non dominant eyes. The mean accommodative lead was found to be greater than the normal individual (dominant eye). Hence, it is concluded that the dominant eye has a better accommodative function than the non dominant eye. © 2022 Innovative Publication, All rights reserved.

Methods: Fifty-four subjects (19 anisometropic amblyopia, 20 treated amblyopia, and 15 normal children) participated in this study. The visual acuity that was tested under dichoptic-optotypes condition (i.e., presented optotypes to the untested eye) was compared with that under monocular condition (i.e., cover the untested eye with opaque patch). Visual acuity differences between these two conditions were compared among the three groups. The correlations between visual acuity differences and the depth of interocular suppression were then computed. Some participants performed the visual acuity test under dichoptic-luminance condition (i.e., presented mean luminance to the untested eye), and the test-retest reliability was established. Results: A reduced visual acuity of the non-dominant eye was found in the dichoptic-optotypes condition for the amblyopia group (P < 0.001) and the treated group (P = 0.001); the difference in the treated group was less than that in the amblyopia group (P < 0.001) but more than that in the normal group (P = 0.026). A significant correlation was found between the visual acuity differences and the depth of suppression, which was tested with a binocular phase combination task (P = 0.005). No change was found in the dichoptic-luminance condition. Conclusion: The amblyopic eye and the previous amblyopic eye seem to suffer from a reduced visual acuity when two eyes are open due to suppression. This was successfully captured by our novel and reliable dichoptic-optotypes visual acuity chart. Copyright © 2022 Zhu, Liao and Liu."

Loss of visual acuity is an unfortunate associated effect. Here, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 60 healthy adults. Participants received a diet containing astaxanthin (9 mg/day) or placebo for 6 weeks. Visual acuity, functional visual acuity, and pupil constriction rate were measured before and after visual display terminal work. In participants aged ≥40 years, corrected visual acuity of the dominant eye after visual display terminal work at 6 weeks after intake demonstrated a higher protective effect of astaxanthin in the astaxanthin group vs the control group (p<0.05). In participants aged <40 years, no significant difference was seen between the astaxanthin and control groups. Moreover, no significant difference was found in functional visual acuity and pupil constriction rate between the astaxanthin and control groups. These results suggest astaxanthin reduces oxidative stress caused by visual display terminal work. Age-related reduction in ciliary muscle strength is likely the main detractor of visual acuity. Correspondingly, astaxanthin reduced visual display terminal work-induced visual stress in the middle-aged and elderly. This study was registered in the UMIN-CTR database (UMIN000043089). ©2023 JCBN.
Soma M.;0.0;Behavioral and Evolutionary Perspectives on Visual Lateralization in Mating Birds: A Short Systematic Review;2022;Frontiers in Physiology;10.3389/fphys.2021.801385;The division of cognitive processing between the two hemispheres of the brain causes lateralized eye use in various behavioral contexts. Generally, visual lateralization is shared among vertebrates to a greater extent, with little interspecific variation. However, previous studies on the visual lateralization in mating birds have shown surprising heterogeneity. Therefore, this systematic review paper summarized and analyzed them using phylogenetic comparative methods. The review aimed to elucidate why some species used their left eye and others their right to fixate on individuals of the opposite sex, such as mating partners or prospective mates. It was found that passerine and non-passerine species showed opposite eye use for mating, which could have stemmed from the difference in altricial vs. precocial development. However, due to the limited availability of species data, it was impossible to determine whether the passerine group or altricial development was the primary factor. Additionally, unclear visual lateralization was found when studies looked at lek mating species and males who performed courtship. These findings are discussed from both evolutionary and behavioral perspectives. Possible directions for future research have been suggested. Copyright © 2022 Soma.

To date, no other review has assimilated existing research on reading difficulties and atypical development of processes reflected in the N170w response. Hence, this systematic review synthesized results and evaluated neurophysiological and experimental procedures across different studies about visual print expertise in reading development. Literature databases were examined for relevant studies from 1995 to 2020 investigating the N170w response in individuals with or without reading disorders. To capture the development of the N170w related to reading, results were compared between three different age groups: pre-literate children, school-aged children, and young adults. The majority of available N170w studies (N = 69) investigated adults (n = 31) followed by children (school-aged: n = 21; pre-literate: n = 4) and adolescents (n = 1) while some studies investigated a combination of these age groups (n = 12). Most studies were conducted with German-speaking populations (n = 17), followed by English (n = 15) and Chinese (n = 14) speaking participants. The N170w was primarily investigated using a combination of words, pseudowords, and symbols (n = 20) and mostly used repetition-detection (n = 16) or lexical-decision tasks (n = 16). Different studies posed huge variability in selecting electrode sites for analysis; however, most focused on P7, P8, and O1 sites of the international 10–20 system. Most of the studies in adults have found a more negative N170w in controls than poor readers, whereas in children, the results have been mixed. In typical readers, N170w ranged from having a bilateral distribution to a left-hemispheric dominance throughout development, whereas in young, poor readers, the response was mainly right-lateralized and then remained in a bilateral distribution. Moreover, the N170w latency has varied according to age group, with adults having an earlier onset yet with shorter latency than school-aged and pre-literate children. This systematic review provides a comprehensive picture of the development of print expertise as indexed by the N170w across age groups and reading abilities and discusses theoretical and methodological differences and challenges in the field, aiming to guide future research.

Methods: Twenty subjects with presbyopia performed two standard methods of binary eye dominance identification (sensory with +1.50 diopters [D ]and +0.50 D and sighting with “hole-in-the-card”) and two psychophysical methods of perceived visual quality: (1) the Preferential test, 26 natural images were judged with the near addition in one eye or in the other in a 2-interval forced-choice task, and the Eye Dominance Strength (EDS) defined as the proportion of trials where one monovision is preferred over the other; (2) the Multifocal Acceptance Score (MAS-2EV) test, the perceived quality of a natural images set (for 2 luminance levels and distances) was scored and EDS defined as the score difference between monovision in one eye or the other. Left-eye and right-eye dominance are indicated with negative and positive values, respectively. Tests were performed using a Simultaneous Vision Simulator, which allows rapid changes between corrections. Results: Standard sensory and sighting dominances matched in only 55% of subjects. The Preferential EDS (ranging from −0.7 to +0.9) and MAS-2EV EDS (ranging from −0.6 to +0.4) were highly correlated. Selecting the eye for far in monovision with the MAS-2EV, sensory, or sighting tests would have resulted in 79%, 64%, and 43% success consid-ering the Preferential test as the gold standard. Conclusions: Tests based on perceptual preference allow selection of the preferred monovision correction and measurement of dominance strength.

Binocular rivalry and binocular combination techniques are used interchangeably to characterize homeostatic plasticity, sometimes leading to contradictory results. Here we directly compare the effect of short-term monocular deprivation on ocular dominance measured by either binocular rivalry or binocular combination and its dependence on the duration of deprivation (15 or 120 min) in the same group of participants. Our results show that both binocular rivalry and binocular combination provide reliable estimates of ocular dominance, which are strongly correlated across techniques both before and after deprivation. Moreover, while 15 min of monocular deprivation induce a larger shift of ocular dominance when measured using binocular combination compared to binocular rivalry, for both techniques, the shift in ocular dominance exhibits a strong dependence on the duration of monocular deprivation, with longer deprivation inducing a larger and longer-lasting shift in ocular dominance. Taken together, our results indicate that both binocular rivalry and binocular combination offer very consistent and reliable measurements of both ocular dominance and the effect short-term monocular deprivation. © 2023 The Author(s)

Method: This prospective observational study evaluated 51 eyes of 30 patients with photic retinopathy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging was performed for all the eyes at baseline and final follow-up. All the eyes showed a focal outer retinal defect on spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) at the junction of the inner and outer photoreceptor segments. SD-OCT was used to measure central macular thickness, maximum horizontal dimension of the defect, maximum defect thickness, and the photic retinopathy index (PRI) through the foveal raster scan. Results: Although PRI improved significantly at the final follow-up from baseline with a 17% improvement in PRI after a period of 6 months in photic retinopathy eyes, visual acuity declined for 14% of the patients and was stable for 84%. There was mild correlation of visual acuity with baseline PRI. Baseline PRI was significantly higher in eyes with poorer presenting visual acuity (VA). In total, 33.3% of the eyes showed partial ellipsoid zone recovery at 6 months. The area under curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve for partial ellipsoid zone recovery with the mean baseline PRI as the independent variable was poor at 0.612. Conclusion: OCT-based ultrastructural features in photic retinopathy seem to have poor correlation with presenting or final visual acuity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study on longitudinal OCT evaluation of photic retinopathy eyes in literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.
"Razzak A.R.; Jahrami H.; Husni M.; Ali M.E.; Bagust J.";0.0;Symptom severity is associated with leftward lateralization upon contextual modulation of visual vertical in patients with schizophrenia;2022;Frontiers in Psychiatry;10.3389/fpsyt.2022.948114;Background: Contextual processing dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) is not uniform and task-dependent. In SCZ, studies on the rod and frame test (RFT), which evaluates contextual modulation of verticality perception, are sparse. A main study that utilized a two-alternative forced choice design for judging rod verticality reported equivalent strength of RFT contextual modulation in healthy controls and SCZ. The current study aims to uncover any potential differences in contextual modulation between controls and SCZ with an adjustment method on a computerized RFT. Materials and methods: A total of 17 healthy controls and 15 SCZ aligned an oriented rod to their perceived vertical with a computer mouse under four randomized frame presentations: absent frame, non-tilted (Frame0°), or tilted by 18 degrees leftward (Frame–18°) or rightward (Frame+18°). Rod deviation error was assigned a negative or positive value when aligned leftward or rightward, respectively, of 0°. Signed and absolute errors, the rod and frame effect (RFE), and intra-individual variability (inconsistency) were used for analysis. Results: There was no group difference in rod alignment errors or derived measures, except that SCZ displayed greater inconsistency in rod alignment, compared to controls. The negative symptom scale (PANSS-N) scores correlated positively with the variability measure and with unsigned Frame–18° error. Conclusions: Only the variability measure was sensitive enough to distinguish between controls and SCZ. SCZ with more severe negative symptoms had larger variability in rod alignment, probably reflecting a state of indifference. The larger deviation errors only with a leftward tilted frame, as PANSS-N scores increased, may indicate a lateralized attentional abnormality that is correlated with severity of symptoms in SCZ.

A total of 42 articles were initially identified, but after applying the selection criteria and an additional manual search a total of 23 articles were finally included: 2 non-randomized controlled clinical trials (NRCT) and 21 case series. Quality assessment of NRCTs and case series was performed with the ROBINS-I and the 20-criterion quality appraisal checklist defined by Moga et al. (IHE Publ 2012), respectively. For NRCT, the risk of bias was moderate in one study and serious in the other NRCT, being the main sources of risk, the domains related to confounding, selection of participants and measurement of outcomes. For case series studies, the main source of risk of bias was subjects not entering the study at the same point of the conditions (different levels of presbyopia). Likewise, a significant level of uncertainty was detected for the following items: consecutive recruitment of patients, blinding of outcome assessors to the intervention that the patient received, and conclusions of the study not supported by the results. Research on presbyLASIK to this date is mainly focused on case series generating a limited level of scientific evidence. The two NRCTs identified only demonstrated the potential benefit of combining the multiaspheric profile with some level of monovision in the non-dominant eye. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

Patient involvement: This study collected open ended qualitative responses of treatment preference, acceptability, and feasibility as a key outcome. Methods: Adults aged 25 to 65 years with sleep duration <7 h and BMI ≥ 25 were randomized into one of four groups: Self-Management (control), Fitbit, Telephone Coaching, or Fitbit + Coaching. Self-report questionnaires and actigraphy were completed at baseline, post-intervention (6 weeks), and 12-weeks. Analyses used mixed models. Results: Among the 38 adults randomized, the Fitbit + Coaching group had larger but non-significant improvements in sleep duration compared with the self-management group. The coaching group demonstrated significant improvements in sleep-related impairment. All groups demonstrated feasibility and acceptability but the Fitbit + Coaching group reported themes of accountability. Conclusions: Results suggest that sleep extension interventions are feasible and acceptable but components affect the pattern of sleep and other outcomes.

The SIOL has been implanted in the dominant eyes, all patients were divided into three groups according to the types of IOL implanted in the contralateral non - dominant eyes, among them, there were 36 eyes of 18 cases in group A with non - dominant eyes implanted MIOL (SBL - 3); 38 eyes of 19 cases in group B were implanted MIOL (SN6AD1) in non - dominant eyes. SIOL was implanted in all 46 eyes of 23 cases of control group. After operation at 3mo,the results of binocular vision and visual quality of the three groups were evaluated and compared. RESULTS: After operationat 3mo, there was no difference in the uncorrected distance vision and corrected distance vision, uncorrected medium vision and corrected near vision among the three groups (P < 0. 05) . The uncorrected near visual acuity and corrected intermediate visual acuity of both eyes in groups A and B were significantly improved in both groups compared with the control group (P < 0.05) . The scores of Catquest 9SF - CN scale showed that the quality of life of patients in group A and group B (11.11± 1.323, 11.89± 1.883 scores) was better than that in the control group (14. 65 ± 1. 722 scores, both P< 0. 05) .

The neural substrates underlying this functional imbalance are not well known. Here, we investigated the relationship between visual white matter tract properties and SED in the human neurotypical population. Observers’ performance on two commonly used dichoptic tasks were used to index SED, along with performance on a third task to address a functional implication of binocular imbalance: stereovision. We show that diffusivity metrics of the optic radiations (ORs) well predict behavioral SED metrics. We found no relationship between SED and stereosensitivity. Our data suggest that SED is not simply reflected by gray matter structural and functional alterations, as often suggested, but relates, at least in part to the microstructural properties of thalamocortical white matter. © 2022 Chan and Chang.

Still, there is ongoing debate about the characteristics of neuronal noise and the mechanisms of adaptation, and even less is known about how exactly they affect perception. Noise and adaptation are critical in binocular rivalry, a visual phenomenon where two images compete for perceptual dominance. Here, we investigated the effects of different noise processes and adaptation mechanisms on visual perception by simulating a model of binocular rivalry with Gaussian white noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and pink noise, in variants with divisive adaptation, subtractive adaptation, and without adaptation. By simulating the nine models in parameter space, we find that white noise only produces rivalry when paired with subtractive adaptation and that subtractive adaptation reduces the influence of noise intensity on rivalry strength and introduces convergence of the mean percept duration, an important metric of binocular rivalry, across all noise processes. In sum, our results show that white noise is an insufficient description of background activity in the brain and that subtractive adaptation is a stronger and more general switching mechanism in binocular rivalry than divisive adaptation, with important noise-filtering properties. © Copyright 2023 The Authors

Method and materials: A total of 104 selected participants consisting of dental students and dental practitioners were allocated into two groups based on their clinical experience of using visual shade matching tabs for the selection of tooth shade. Both the inexperienced (IXP), as well as experienced participants (EXP), were then asked to correctly match the shades of five tabs (A2, A3.5, B1, C2, and D3) of a commonly used visual shade guide (Vitapan Classical shade guide, VITA Zahnfabrik) that were kept constant throughout the study. The participants documented the shade of those tabs using another set of shade guide using the right eye (left eye covered), left eye (right eye covered), as well as both eyes. Test for ocular dominance was performed using the Dolman method. The results were statistically analyzed using the chi-square test with a level of significance set at < .05. Results: The percentage of correct shade matching with the monocular dominant vision (53%) was significantly better as compared to the monocular non-dominant vision (12%) (P < .001) or binocular vision (44%) (P < .05). Sex had an influence in shade selection (P = .031). However, clinical experience was an insignificant aspect in shade matching (P = .078). Conclusions: Knowing the clinician’s dominant eye can be clinically relevant, as it can influence the accuracy of shade selection, irrespective of sex and clinical experience. © 2022 Quintessence Publishing Co., Ltd.

Psychophysiological disorders and speech pathology is one of the priority public health problems in the Republic of Serbia. A child’s growth and development proceed in a particular sequence and course, depending on individual physiological capacities, quality of neuromuscular structures, and stimuli, which can be significantly affected by the environment. The development of speech from birth to the adult age is a result of the interaction of neurocognitive factors that contribute to the gradual attainment of phonological presentation and motor control abilities. The aim of the study was to examine the connection between manipulative manual dexterity, oral praxis, and lateralization with the development and speech in children and their potential for the development of prevention programs. Methods. The sample included 60 children from Belgrade of both sexes, aged between 5.5 and 7 years. Of these, 30 made up the experimental group – children with deviations in speech development (articulation disorders), and 30 made up the control group – typically developing children from the general population. The instruments used were the Manipulative Manual Dexterity Test (Lafayette), Oral Praxis Test, and part of the Test for assessing lateralization (auditory, visual, and functional). Results. The hand grip development level was statistically significantly different between the experimental and the control group (χ2 = 21.40, df = 3, p < 0.01). The presence of associated involuntary movements statistically significantly differed between the experimental and the control group examinees (χ2 = 10.58, df = 1, p < 0.01). Oral praxis statistically significantly differed between the experimental and the control group (t = 2.01, p < 0.05). Visual laterality statistically significantly differed (χ2 = 7.56, p < 0.05) between the observed groups. When all predictors were taken into account, significant contribution to the explanation of the existence of speech pathology (articulation disorders) was given by the variables: Visual lateralization [odd ratio (OR) = 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.179–0.832; p = 0.015] and the level of hand grip development (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.082–0.699; p = 0.009). Conclusion. The hand grip development level and visual laterality are worse in children with speech (articulation) impairment and developmental deviations. These indicators of child development should be used as a guide in designing the national programs for developmental assessment and prevention in the child healthcare system. © The Author(s) 2022."

Postural control (postural sway centre of pressure) was evaluated during tandem stance, leading with dominant and non-dominant limbs with eyes open and closed, using an AMTI force platform. Fundamental motor skills were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development 2nd Edition, examining total, locomotor and object control scores. Data were analysed using linear regression, adjusted for body mass index percentile and household income. For locomotor skills, significant relationships were found with a number of postural sway outcomes for adjusted and unadjusted analyses (r − 0.287 to r − 0.425, p ≤ 0.042). Total motor skill score was significantly related to postural sway in the tandem dominant eyes closed condition for unadjusted and adjusted analyses (r ≥ −0.294, p ≤ 0.04). In conclusion, our findings indicate that postural control may be important for fundamental motor skill proficiency and movement quality in pre-adolescent girls, particularly for locomotor skills. Our study provides evidence supporting the clinical practice of assessing postural control in girls presenting with motor skill deficits. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Such medical devices make it possible to obtain information on people’s health status; taking into account the most common signs, such as: blood pressure, heart rate, as well as glucose levels and oxygenation in the blood, among others. However, when it is necessary to make a diagnosis related to mental, ocular and some other health conditions, more sophisticated equipment is required, limiting the scope for access due to its level of specialization and disposition in the medical area. This article proposes the use of pupillometry; as a non-invasive technique, to analyze the response of the photomotor reflex by means of LED flash stimuli in healthy individuals. Through the implementation of an experimental prototype of a low-cost pupillometer, pupillary images of the dominant eye were obtained in 13 people of both genders. This prototype includes a 2 mega-pixel (MP) web camera, a lighting system composed of infrared and RGB led diodes, with which the recording of images in low-light environments is possible, as well as the induction of stimuli for the study of the behavior of the motor reflex, respectively. As results, the design and implementation of a robust algorithm that is capable of estimating the diameters of the pupil is shown, taking into consideration its previous diameters or the variation of its position due to involuntary movements of the subject and recovering samples of information lost due to blinking or partially occluded pupils during image registration. This process has a segmentation performance of 90.5% for all the images acquired. Additionally, with the proposed algorithm, pupillary behavior can be defined through the features of the pupillary diameters before, during and after illumination, obtaining the average impact among the analyzed subjects. © 2023 National Institute of Optoelectronics.

"Skerswetat J.; Bex P.J.";0.0;InFoRM (Indicate-Follow-Replay-Me): A novel method to measure perceptual multistability dynamics using continuous data tracking and validated estimates of visual introspection;2023;Consciousness and Cognition;10.1016/j.concog.2022.103437;Perceptual multistability, e.g. Binocular Rivalry, has been intensively used as a tool to study visual consciousness. Current methods to assess multistability do not capture all potentially occurring perceptual states, provide no estimate of introspection, and lack continuous, high-temporal resolution to resolve perceptual changes between states and within mixed perceptual states. We introduce InFoRM (Indicate-Follow-Replay-Me), a four-phase method that (1) trains a participant to self-generate estimates of perceptual introspection-maps that are (2) validated during a physical mimic task, (3) gathers perceptual multistability data, and (4) confirms their validity during a physical replay. 28 condition-blinded adults performed InFoRM while experiencing binocular rivalry evoked with orthogonal sinusoidal gratings. A 60 Hz joystick (3600 data samples/minute) was used to indicate continuously changes across six perceptual states within each 1 min trial. A polarized monitor system was used to present the stimuli dichoptically. Three contrast conditions were investigated: low vs low, high vs high, and low vs high. InFoRM replicates standard outcome measures, i.e. alternation rate, mean and relative proportions of perception, and distribution of exclusive percepts that are well fitted with gamma functions. Furthermore, InFoRM generates novel outcomes that deliver new insights in visual cognition via estimates of introspection maps, in ocular dominance via perceptual-state-specific dominance scores, in transitory dynamics between and within perceptual states, via techniques adopted from eye-tracking, and in rivalry-zone-size estimates utilizing InFoRM's ability to simulate piecemeal perception. The replay phase (physical replay of perceptual rivalry) confirmed good overall agreement (73% ±5 standard deviation). InFoRM can be applied to other multistable paradigms and can be used to study visual consciousness in typical and neuro-atypical populations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Many neurotrophic factors are also expressed in adult brain, where they regulate neuronal connectivity and network plasticity. Neurotrophic factors are typically released from the target cells or postsynaptic neurons, taken up by the presynaptic axon terminals and retrogradely transported to the soma. Access of the axon terminal to neurotrophic factors selects among excessively generated neurons or neuronal processes for survival those that have established an optimal connection with the target cell, whereas neurons or processes with an insufficient access or transport of neurotrophic factors degenerate. Therefore, the primary function of neurotrophic factors is to mediate information to the neuronal soma about the quality of the connection between a neuron and its target. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013, 2016 and Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

During IOC, one image temporarily dominates perception, while the other is suppressed. Many factors affecting IOC have been extensively examined. One factor that received surprisingly little attention, however, is the stimulus’ visual hemifield (VHF) of origin. This is remarkable, as the VHF location of stimuli is known to affect visual performance in various contexts. Prompted by exploratory analyses, we examined five independent datasets of breaking continuous flash suppression experiments, to establish the VHF’s role in IOC. We found that targets presented in nasal VHF locations broke through suppression much faster than targets in temporal VHF locations. Furthermore, we found that the magnitude of this nasal advantage depended on how strongly the targets were suppressed: the nasal advantage was larger for the recessive eye than for the dominant eye, and was larger in observers with a greater dominance imbalance between the eyes. Our findings suggest that the nasal advantage reported here originates in processing stages where IOC is resolved. Finally, we propose that a nasal advantage in IOC serves an adaptive role in human vision, as it can aid perception of partially occluded objects. © 2022, The Author(s).
"Zwierko T.; Redondo B.; Jedziniak W.; Molina R.; Jiménez R.; Vera J.";0.0;Gaze behaviour during multiple object tracking is dependent on binocular vision integrity;2023;Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics;10.1111/opo.13225;Introduction: Despite the critical importance of binocular vision integrity in daily activities, there exists limited understanding of how alterations in binocular vision integrity impact gaze behaviour during dynamic, complex psychomotor skills. This study aimed to measure how alterations in binocular vision integrity, created by Bangerter filters (BF), affect gaze behaviour during multiple object tracking (MOT). Methods: During the experiment, 22 volunteers completed the MOT task under three different visual conditions. The first condition involved natural binocular viewing, while the second and third conditions used 0.4 and 0.2 neutral density BF, respectively, resulting in monocular blur in the sensorially dominant eye. During the MOT task, participants were instructed to track three of eight balls for 10 s, and the speed was adjusted using a staircase procedure. Throughout the task, the following gaze parameters were recorded: fixation duration, saccade duration, amplitude and frequency as well as blink rate. Results: During MOT execution, participants employed three gaze strategies regardless of viewing conditions: saccadic movements were predominant, followed by maintaining fixation on a central location throughout the trial and to a lesser extent, smooth pursuit eye movements. There was a significant effect of manipulating viewing conditions on the MOT scores (p = 0.046, η2 = 0.09). As the viewing conditions became more difficult, we observed a decrease in fixation duration (p = 0.004, η2 = 0.16) and blink rate (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.20) and an increase in saccadic amplitude (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.29). Conclusions: The results support the notion that perceptual-cognitive skills depend on the integrity of binocular vision, underscoring the sensitivity of gaze behaviours to any impairment of binocular function. © 2023 College of Optometrists.

METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients with cataract were treated with the implantation of the Artis Symbiose Mid (Mid) IOL (Cristalens Industrie) in the distance-dominant eye and the Artis Symbiose Plus (Plus) IOL (Cristalens Industrie) in the contralateral eye following phacoemulsification. The primary objective was to ascertain the monocular and binocular defocus curves. Secondary endpoints included uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected intermediate visual acuity, and distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity at 90 and 70 cm, uncorrected near visual acuity and distance-corrected visual acuity at 40 cm, contrast sensitivity, LDI with a halometer, stereopsis, and patients’ QoL with the validated Visual Function Index (VF-14) questionnaire. These measurements were collected in two visits, at 4.14 ± 3.13 and 10.30 ± 3.14 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in the monocular defocus curves were found at the defocus steps of -1.00, -1.25, -1.50, -1.75, -2.50, -2.75, -3.00, -3.50 diopters and the -4.00 diopters (P <.050). The mean binocular defocus curve was 0 logMAR or better from the +0.50 to the -2.50 D defocus steps. Contrast sensitivity was within normal values. The LDI was 12.57 (6.61)% for the Mid eyes, 14.99 ± 5.70% for the Plus eyes, and 10.36 ± 4.42% binocularly. The patients’ stereopsis was 40.0 (12.5) arcseconds. The QoL score was 95.99 (7.14) at 10 months. CONCLUSIONS: The implantation of the Artis Symbiose IOLs was a safe and effective treatment for presbyopia compensation in patients with cataract. Both IOLs are complementary and may produce a binocular depth-of-field of 3.00 diopters over 0 logMAR when used together. © 2023 Lajara-Blesa, Rodríguez-Izquierdo, Vallés-San-Leandro, et al.

DESIGN: Perspective. METHODS: Collection, review, and analysis of all cases in the literature and in the authors’ databases of HFL hemorrhage in MacTel2, including analysis of baseline and follow-up multimodal retinal imaging findings of selected cases. Elucidation of the complex interplay of systemic venous pressure with the deep retinal capillary plexus and hypothesis regarding the right-sided predilection of HFL hemorrhage complicating MacTel2. RESULTS: Ten patients presented with a unilateral, characteristic radial macular hemorrhage within the HFL that affected only the right eye in all cases. Absence of SRNV was confirmed by fluorescein angiography and/or optical coherence tomography angiography. The hemorrhage resolved spontaneously in at least 7 of the 10 eyes. The HFL hemorrhage may plausibly be explained by dysfunction of the deep capillary plexus in MacTel2 combined with an acute rise in central venous pressure, for which the right side may be at increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: HFL hemorrhage can complicate MacTel2 in the absence of SRNV, and the radial pattern of blood affecting only the right eye is remarkable. The right eye predominance may be multifactorial in etiology. Related factors may include the right-sided predilection of MacTel2 and/or increased right-sided dural sinus drainage related to normal anatomical variation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Bilateral training in archery is only performed as a supportive coordination training and as a variation of typical exercise. However, a series of studies demonstrated a crossover transfer of training-induced motor skills to the contralateral side, especially in case of mainly unilateral skills. We compared the cervical spine and shoulder kinematics of unilateral and bilateral training archers. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 25 (5 females, 48 ± 14 years) bilaterally training and 50 age-, sex- and level-matched (1:2; 47.3 ± 13.9 years) unilaterally training competitive archers were included. Cervical range of motion (RoM, all planes) and glenohumeral rotation were assessed with an ultrasound-based 3D motion analysis system. Upward rotation of the scapula during abduction and elevation of the arm were measured by means of a digital inclinometer and active shoulder mobility by means of an electronic caliper. All outcomes were compared between groups (unilaterally vs. bilaterally) and sides (pull-hand- vs. bow-hand-side). Results: Unilateral and bilateral archers showed no between group and no side-to-side-differences in either of the movement direction of the cervical spine. The unilateral archers had higher pull-arm-side total glenohumeral rotation than the bilateral archers (mean, 95% CI), (148°, 144–152° vs. 140°, 135°-145°). In particular, internal rotation (61°, 58–65° vs. 56°, 51–61°) and more upward rotation of the scapula at 45 degrees (12°, 11–14° vs. 8°, 6–10°), 90 degrees (34°, 31–36° vs. 28°, 24–32°), 135 degrees (56°, 53–59° vs. 49°, 46–53°), and maximal (68°, 65–70° vs. 62°, 59–65°) arm abduction differed. The bow- and pull-arm of the unilateral, but not of the bilateral archers, differed in the active mobility of the shoulder (22 cm, 20–24 cm vs. 18 cm, 16–20 cm). Conclusions: Unilaterally training archers display no unphysiologic movement behaviour of the cervical spine, but show distinct shoulder asymmetris in the bow- and pull-arm-side when compared to bilateral archers in glenohumeral rotation, scapula rotation during arm abduction, and active mobility of the shoulder. These asymmetries in may exceed physiological performance-enhancing degrees. Bilateral training may seems appropriate in archery to prevent asymmetries. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: 89 healthy children attending a general pediatric clinic. Methods: Participants underwent sighting dominant testing and macular and cpRNFL spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Segmented macular layer thicknesses and cpRNFL thickness were compared for individual patients based on their ocular dominance. Results: Ocular dominance occurred particularly in the right eye (64.7%). Dominant and nondominant eyes did not differ significantly in axial length or spherical equivalent refraction; axial length: 22.99 ± 1.17 mm versus 22.98 ± 1.19 mm; p = 0.51 and spherical equivalent refraction: −0.09 ± 2.68 D versus 0.32 ± 2.93 D; p = 0.41. In the comparison of the macular ganglion layer the average thickness in the 1 mm central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study area was significantly different between the dominant and nondominant eye (16.56 ± 6.02 μm vs 17.58 ± 8.32 μm; p = 0.02). However, when compensating with Bonferroni, this difference was no longer statistically significant. There were no differences in the analyses of average global and sectorial cpRNFL thickness in dominant and nondominant eyes. Conclusion: Dominant eyes demonstrated no significantly thicker average macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL), Ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness or cpRNFL thickness.

The proposed network consists of two main sub-network streams, each of which has three branches to extract low, middle and high spatial frequency information in parallel. To better realize the guidance of the high-level features in the low spatial frequency branch to the low-level features in the high spatial frequency branch, an information feedback guidance module (IFGM) is proposed, which realizes a top-down guidance mechanism in each sub-network stream. Simultaneously, according to the theory of ocular dominance in human visual system (HVS), we design an adaptive bi-directional parallax-based binocular fusion module (BPBFM), which synthesizes two types of fusion feature by taking the left and right view features as dominant eye input. Furthermore, in order to obtain the better perceptual quality of stereo images, we design a weighted fusion strategy to weigh the quality scores from the two types of fusion features obtained by using an ensemble model with two multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The experimental results on four public stereo image datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the mainstream metrics and achieves an excellent performance. IEEE

This study aimed to assess the relationship between the time from the donor's death to the end of processing and corneal cellularity provided by the Eye Bank. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 839 donor records (2013-2021) from the Eye Bank of the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics, totaling 1445 corneas. Donors were classified based on cellularity (≤2000 and >2000 cells/mm2) and laterality. The dependent variable was cellularity in the right eye (RE) and left eye (LE), categorized into ≤2000 and >2000 cells/mm2 groups. Independent variables included sex, age, cause of death, and Δ-death. The statistical software SPSS 26.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc, Armonk, NY, United States) was used, and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among 839 donors, most were male (58.2%) and ≥60 years old (36.5%). Brain death (BD) was the primary cause of death (66.2%). A time from the donor's death to the end of processing interval of ≥10 hours occurred in 35.6% of cases. Cellularity >2000 cells/mm2 was similar for the RE (94.5%) and LE (93.9%). Age showed statistical significance (P < 0.001) in both eyes, with cellularity decreasing for donors ≥60 years. In BD cases, higher cellularity was observed in the LE (P < 0.001; 70.8%). A time from the donor's death to the end of processing interval and cellularity comparison showed relevance for the LE (P = 0.03) but no association for the RE.

Panov G.;0.0;Comparative Analysis of Lateral Preferences in Patients With Resistant Schizophrenia;2022;Frontiers in Psychiatry;10.3389/fpsyt.2022.868285;Background: Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder of diverse etiology and clinical presentation. Despite the expansion of treatment methods, between 30 and 50% of cases remain resistant to treatment. In patients with schizophrenia, specifics in the dominant lateralization in the brain function have been discovered. This gave a reason to seek the relation between functional lateralization and the effect of treatment. Methods: Of the 105 people observed with schizophrenia, 45 (42.9%) were treatment resistant, and 60 (57.1%) were considered responders. We compared functional lateralization (hand, foot, and eye) between the two groups. Handedness was ascertained by using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. The assessment was made at 12 weeks of treatment. Results: Of all patients with schizophrenia, 41.89% have mixed lateralization, 53.34% are right winged, and 4.76% of the patients are left winged. Resistance of the symptoms shows that 26 (57.78%) are cross-dominated, 18 (40%) are right winged, and 1 (2.22%) is left winged. In patients with clinical remission, 18 (30%) are of mixed dominance, 38 (63.33%) are right winged, and 4 (6.66%) are left winged. From the results for the separate lateralization of the hand, foot, and eye, we found a significant difference only in terms of the dominance of the eye. In 44 (41.9%) of the patients, we found dominance of the left eye. In patients with resistance, the percentage established by us is higher—at 26 (57.8%). These results indicate that the increased percentage of mixed dominance in patients with schizophrenia is mainly due to left-sided lateralization of the eye, especially in those with resistance to treatment. Conclusion: We find an increased number of patients with cross-dominance left eye dominance in patients with schizophrenia. Cross-dominance and left eye dominance are associated with a higher probability of symptom resistance than other forms of lateralization (left-handed or right-handed). The high percentage of cross-dominance is due to the high percentage of left-sided dominance of the eye. Copyright © 2022 Panov.

In the present study, we reveal an anisotropy of the FLI between the lateral visual fields that was expressed psychophysically as different points of subjective equality, depending on the hemifield in which the stimuli appeared. Specifically, the study confirmed that, as seen in two previous studies, the FLI was significantly larger in the left visual field (LVF) than in the right (RVF). In addition, pupil dilations were larger in the RVF than in the LVF as well as returning to baseline levels more rapidly in the LVF. We interpret these findings as converging on revealing more efficient spatial and attentional processing and, in turn, extrapolation of motion in the LVF/right hemisphere than in the RVF/left hemisphere. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

In this combination, the relative strength of the input from each eye is determined by the ocular dominance. Recent work has shown that this dominance can be temporarily shifted. Covering one eye with an eye patch for a few hours makes its contribution stronger. It has been proposed that this shift can be enhanced by exercise. Here, we test this hypothesis using a dichoptic surround suppression task, and with exercise performed according to American College of Sport Medicine guidelines. We measured detection thresholds for patches of sinusoidal grating shown to one eye. When an annular mask grating was shown simultaneously to the other eye, thresholds were elevated. The difference in the elevation found in each eye is our measure of relative eye dominance. We made these measurements before and after 120 min of monocular deprivation (with an eye patch). In the control condition, subjects rested during this time. For the exercise condition, 30 min of exercise were performed at the beginning of the patching period. This was followed by 90 min of rest. We find that patching results in a shift in ocular dominance that can be measured using dichoptic surround suppression. However, we find no effect of exercise on the magnitude of this shift. We further performed a meta-analysis on the four studies that have examined the effects of exercise on the dominance shift. Looking across these studies, we find no evidence for such an effect. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

It was found that the columns of areas 19, 21a, in comparison with the ocular dominance columns of area 18, receive additional cortical inputs from the ipsilateral transition zone 17/18, which indicates a more complex structure of neural connections. In the localization of input neurons from the transition zones 17/18 of different hemispheres, mirror symmetry was revealed, which can provide the neurons of areas 19, 21a columns with tuning to loci located in the central sagittal plane of the three-dimensional space.

Methods: The monofocal EDOF Isopure IOL was implanted in the dominant eye and the trifocal FineVision HP IOL in the non-dominant eye. Postoperative evaluation included VA at various distances, contrast acuity, monocular defocus curves, decentration and tilt, wavefront aberrometry, VF-7 questionnaire and a halo and glare simulator. Results: 50 eyes of 25 subjects were enroled. The trifocal IOL performed better at monocular DCNVA (p < 0.01) and at defocus levels of –1.5D to –4.0D (p < 0.01), the monofocal EDOF IOL was better at –0.5D (p = 0.013). No differences in monocular BCDVA, DCIVA, contrast acuity, decentration or tilt were observed (p > 0.05). Wavefront analysis revealed lower HOAs in the trifocal group at 5 mm (p < 0.01) and no difference (p = 0.107) at 3 mm pupil aperture. The monofocal EDOF IOL displayed increased negative SA at 5 mm (p < 0.01) and 3 mm (p < 0.01) pupil diameter. Low values of optical phenomena and satisfying results of the VF-7 questionnaire were obtained. Conclusion: Excellent visual performance and low rates of optical phenomena were achieved after mix-and-match implantation of the monofocal EDOF Isopure IOL and the trifocal FineVision HP IOL. Trifocal IOL implantation in the non-dominant eye may decrease optical disturbing phenomena. Similar results were observed for monocular distance, intermediate and contrast VA. The trifocal IOL provided better monocular near VA. Decentration and tilt and HOAs were low. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

In this study, we investigated whether the changes in visual plasticity depended on the duration of deprivation in normal and amblyopic adults. Methods: Twelve anisometropia amblyopic observers (aged 24.8 ± 2.3 years) and 12 age-matched normal observers (aged 23.9 ± 1.2 years) participated in the study. The non-dominant eye of normal observers or amblyopic eye of amblyopic observers was deprived for 30, 120, and 300 min in a randomized order. Their eye balance was measured with a phase combination task, which is a psychophysical test, before and after the deprivation. This design enabled us to measure changes induced in binocular balance as an index visual plasticity due to monocular deprivations. Results: By comparing the ocular dominance changes as a result of monocular deprivation with different deprivation durations, we found evidence that the ocular dominance changes are slightly larger after longer deprivations in both normal and amblyopic observers, albeit with a statistical significance. The changes from 120-min were significantly greater than those from 30-min deprivation in both groups. The magnitude of changes in sensory eye balance was significantly larger in normal observers than that in the amblyopic observers; however, the longevity of changes in visual plasticity was found to be more long-lasting in amblyopic observers than the normal counterparts. Conclusions: The duration of deprivation matters in both normal and amblyopic observers. Ocular dominance imbalance that is typically observed in amblyopia can be more ameliorated with a longer duration of deprivation. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Wallace R.; Olson D.E.; Hooker J.M.";0.0;Neuroplasticity: The Continuum of Change;2023;ACS Chemical Neuroscience;10.1021/acschemneuro.3c00526;Neuroplasticity is a term that is increasingly permeating mainstream discourse and being used by the popular press to simplify descriptions of how the brain changes in response to stimuli such as exercise, sleep, food, drugs of abuse, and medicines, among others. However, it is a complex, multifaceted concept representing a continuum connecting molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes and their effects on human behavior. In this Viewpoint, we examine neuroplasticity from several perspectives to construct a holistic view of this ambiguous term. By engaging experts across various scientific disciplines, we attempt to provide an easy entry point to the concept of neuroplasticity for readers of ACS Chemical Neuroscience. By highlighting how neuroplasticity changes in both health and disease, we demonstrate that the concept is applicable to both adaptive and maladaptive responses to stimuli, underscoring its significance in chemical neuroscience. © 2023 American Chemical Society.
"Acquafredda M.; San I.D.; Steinwurzel C.; Lunghi C.; Binda P.";0.0;Measuring the reliability of binocular rivalry;2023;Journal of Vision;10.1167/JOV.23.10.5;"Binocular rivalry is a widely used tool in sensory and cognitive neuroscience to investigate different aspects of vision and cognition. The dynamics of binocular rivalry (e.g., duration of perceptual dominance phases and mixed percept proportions) differ across individuals; based on rivalry dynamics, it is also possible to calculate an index of ocular dominance (by comparing the perceptual dominance of the images in the two eyes). In this study, we investigated the reliability of binocular rivalry dynamics using different methods for dichoptic stimulation and different rivalry stimuli. For the three main indices we defined (ocular dominance, phase durations and mixed percept proportions), we found a high test–retest reliability across sessions. Moreover, the test–retest reliability of the ocular dominance index was predictable from its internal consistency, supporting its stability overtime. Phase durations and mixed percept proportions, in contrast, had worse test–retest reliability than expected based on internal consistency, indicating that these parameters are susceptible to state-dependent changes. Our results support the use of the ocular dominance index and binocular rivalry in the measurement of sensory eye dominance and its plasticity, but advise caution when investigating the association between phase durations or mixed percepts and stable characteristics like psychological traits or disorders. © 2023.

(2) Methods: College students were randomly assigned to perform the working memory task based on either a single (visual or auditory) or dual (audiovisual) stimulus. Reaction times, accuracy, and WM performance were compared across the two groups to investigate effects of audiovisual interactions. (3) Results: With low cognitive load (2-back), auditory stimuli had no effect on visual working memory, whereas visual stimuli had a small effect on auditory working memory. With high cognitive load (3-back), auditory stimuli interfered (large effect size) with visual WM, and visual stimuli interfered (medium effect size) with auditory WM. (4) Conclusions: Audiovisual effects on WM follow the resource competition theory, and the cognitive load of a visual stimulus is dominated by competition; vision always interferes with audition, and audition conditionally interferes with vision. With increased visual cognitive load, competitive effects of audiovisual interactions were more obvious than those with auditory stimuli. Compared with visual stimuli, audiovisual stimuli showed significant interference only when visual cognitive load was high. With low visual cognitive load, the two stimulus components neither facilitated nor interfered with the other in accordance with a speed–accuracy trade-off. © 2022 by the authors.

Setting: Percy Military Hospital and private Laser Victor Hugo Center, France. Design: Observational retrospective nonrandomized. Methods: Twenty-three patients who had undergone presbyPRK or presbyLASIK were included and followed up for 12-months. Far and near visual acuity without correction in monocular and binocular, measurement of distance visual acuity with correction in monocular, evaluation of spherical equivalent (SE), aberrometry, and patient satisfaction were measured and analyzed in this study. Results: The study included 26 eyes of 13 patients in the presbyLASIK group and 20 eyes of 10 patients in the presbyPRK group. The mean age was 55.43 ± 4.6 years. Uncorrected binocular distance visual acuity was 0.030 ± 0.05 logMAR in the presbyLASIK group and 0 logMAR in the presbyPRK group (P =.066). Binocular near visual acuity without correction was 0.21 ± 0.11 logMAR in the presbyLASIK group and 0.30 ± 0.15 logMAR in the presbyPRK group (P =.0398).

Methods: Characteristics of sensory fusion were evaluated in 25 participants (age 12– 69 years) with normal (n = 6) and abnormal (n = 19) binocular vision. Suppression zone size and classification of fusion were determined by W4DApp and by flashlight Worth 4 Dot (W4D) responses from 33 cm to 6 m. Measures of suppression depth were compared between the W4DApp, the flashlight W4D with neutral density filter bar and the dichoptic letters contrast balance index test. Results: There was high agreement in classification of fusion between the W4DApp method and that derived from flashlight W4D responses from 33 cm to 6 m (α = 0.817). There were no significant differences in success rates or in reliability between the W4DApp or the flashlight W4D methods for determining suppression zone size. W4DApp suppression zone size strongly correlated to that determined with the flashlight W4D (rho = 0.964, P < 0.001). W4DApp depth of suppression measures showed significantly higher success rates (χ2 = 5.128, P = 0.043) and reliability (intraclass correlation analysis = 0.901) but no significant correlation to the depth of suppression calculated by flashlight W4D and neutral density bar (rho = 0.301, P = 0.399) or contrast balance index (rho =−0.018, P = 0.958). Conclusions: The W4DApp has potential clinical benefit in measuring suppression zone size; however, further modifications are required to improve validity of suppression depth measures.

With considerable interpatient variability in the rate of GA progression due to lesion characteristics, information characterizing the disease burden is limited. The aim of this study was to describe the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs associated with increasing severity levels of GA. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using claims data from IQVIA’s PharMetrics Plus database. Patients with a prevalent GA diagnosis were identified between October 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 and classified by disease severity and laterality. Disease-specific HCRU and costs by disease severity were assessed during the 12-month follow-up period, with multivariable analyses performed adjusting for baseline characteristics. Results: A total of 28,773 GA cases were identified (mean age = 68.7; 58.5% female), of which 24% and 76% had unilateral and bilateral GA, respectively, with varying levels of recorded severity (in increasing order): early or intermediate (EI) AMD, GA without sub-foveal involvement (GAwoSF), and GA with subfoveal involvement (GAwSF). Patients with greater baseline severity in the bilateral group had a significantly higher number of outpatient (OP) visits per year (1.98 EI AMD; 2.57 for GAwoSF; 2.63 for GAwSF). Increasing disease severity was associated with higher patient-related costs in the outpatient setting (mean [SD] of $82 [$157], $110 [$559] for unilateral EI AMD and GAwSF, respectively, and $56 [$94], $64 [$97], $59 [$85] for bilateral EI AMD, GAwoSF, GAwSF, respectively). Similarly, higher payer-related costs were seen in patients with bilateral GAwSF compared to bilateral EI AMD (mean [SD] $280 [$325]; $198 [$262]). Conclusion: Study findings demonstrate that patients, with more severe GA at baseline, experience greater HCRU and costs in the outpatient setting. Further research should explore specific contributing factors to the long-term economic burden of GA. © 2021 Kim et al."

MA manifests itself as selective alterations in visual acuity (VA), with substantial differences in the ability to resolve contours of different orientations, and may cause impairments in mechanisms of integrated processing of visual stimulus, development of cognitive abilities in children and visual performance. Purpose: To assess the effect of optical-reflection method of accommodative facility training on vernier acuity in meridians (MVA) in the treatment of astigmatic children with amblyopia. Material and Methods: Twenty seven children aged 5 to 12 years, with both refractive amblyopia and with-The-rule hyperopic astigmatism were included in the study, and underwent an examination. The spherical component of refraction ranged from +0.5D to +5.5D, and the cylindical component, from 0.5D to 4.5D. Best-corrected visual acuity (Sivtsev Chart) was assessed. Accommodative facility training was performed monocularly by image defocusing with lenses of a variable power. A +0.5-D sphere was placed just in front of the best correction for the study eye in order to blur this line. The +0.5-D sphere was replaced by a-0.5-D sphere after the optotypes became clearly visible. Thereafter, the training cycle was repeated using a 0.75-D sphere and, subsequently, a 1.0-D sphere. Lens power was gradually increased until it could be compensated by accommodation. The treatment course consisted of one training session a day for 10 days. Special computer software was used to determine corrected MVA. Linear objects were presented on the computer screen, and the smallest lateral displacement of one line from another that can be detected by the examinee will characterize the level of MVA. Results: A new algorithm was proposed for assessing the efficacy of treatment of MA in astigmats, with refractive asymmetries and meridional asymmetries in vernier acuity considered as vector quantities. It was demonstrated that a group of amblyops with the same type of astigmatism was not homogeneous. It was found possible to split such a group of patients into three clusters that differ in the type of variation in meridional acuity in the orthogonal meridians compared to refractive asymmetries. One cluster had equal vernier acuities in the vertical and horizontal meridians, the second had vernier acuity in the horizontal meridian better than in the vertical meridian, and the third had vernier acuity in the horizontal meridian worse than in the vertical meridian. MVA was greater in magnitude in one of the orthogonal meridians than in another in the dominant eyes in 37% of study patients, and in the fellow eyes in 50% of study patients. MVA values in the orthogonal meridians were similar in 56.6% of study patients. There was a 15.1-percent increase, from 56.6% to 71.1% in the number of eyes with a similar vernier acuity in the orthogonal meridians after treatment. A positive effect was achieved through elimination of meridional asymmetry in vernier acuity in a portion of patients from clusters that differ in the direction of meridional asymmetry in vernier acuity. In addition, the number of eyes in the category of patients with a visual acuity of 0.75-0.8 (as assessed with complex optotypes) increased by 11.35%. Conclusion: The efficacy of treatment for MA should be assessed in homogeneous clusters with similar direction of meridional asymmetry in visual acuity. Preliminary data on the efficacy of treatment of amblyopia by accommodative facility training allows considering this training as a method of treatment for meridional amblyopia. The method of determination of meridional acuity should be included in the standard examination of patients with amblyopia. © 2021 Phosphen Ltd.. All rights reserved.

However, the magnitude of the change in eye dominance after monocular deprivation (i.e., the patching effect) has been found to be different between different methods and within the same method. There are three possible explanations for the discrepancy. First, the mechanisms underlying the patching effect that are probed by different measurement tasks might exist at different neural sites. Second, the test-retest variability of the same test can produce inconsistent results. Third, the magnitude of the patching effect itself within the same observer can vary across separate days or experimental sessions. To explore these possibilities, we assessed the test-retest reliability of the three most commonly used tasks (binocular rivalry, binocular combination, and dichoptic masking) and the repeatability of the shift in eye dominance after short-term monocular deprivation for each of the task. Two variations for binocular phase combination were used, at one and many contrasts of the stimuli. Also, two variations for dichoptic masking were employed; the orientation of the mask grating was either horizontal or vertical. Thus, five different tasks were evaluated. We hoped to resolve some of the inconsistencies reported in the literature concerning this form of visual plasticity. In this study, we also aimed to recommend a measurement method that would allow us to better understand its physiological basis and the underpinning of visual disorders."

The result of this study is applicable for designing new gesture interfaces which are close to a user’s cognition, intuitive, and easy to use. The user study investigates the relationship between the participant’s dominances and pointing gestures. Four participant groups—right-handed right-eye dominant, right-handed left-eye dominant, left-handed right-eye dominant and left-handed left-eye dominant—were prepared, and participants were asked to point at the targets on a screen by their left and right hands. The pointing errors among the different participant groups are calculated and compared. The result of this user study shows that using dominant eyes produces better results than using non-dominant eyes and the accuracy increases when the targets are located at the same side of dominant eye. Based on these interesting properties, a method to find the dominant eye for pointing gestures is proposed. This method can find the dominant eye of an individual with more than 90% accuracy.

Design: Retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series. Participants: All patients undergoing primary treatment using PDT with verteporfin from April 2014 to December 2015 and followed until December 2019. Methods: This is a long-term follow-up study of the same cohort of patients previously reported by our group in 2017 and 2018. Main Outcome Measures: Local tumor control, visual outcomes, and metastasis-free survival. Results: Twenty-six patients were included with a mean (± standard deviation) age and tumor thickness of 62 ± 14 years and 1.3 ± 0.5 mm, respectively. Tumors were posteriorly located (mean distance to optic nerve and fovea = 2.0 ± 2.2 mm and 1.6 ± 1.5 mm, respectively), and the majority were fully pigmented (73%). Overall, patients were followed for a median (interquartile range [IQR], range) of 49.5 (15.3, 7.0–66.0) months from first PDT to last follow-up. Over the course of this study, 14 of 26 (54%) have developed a local recurrence at a median of 20.0 months (20.5, 4.7–60.9 months). The most common pattern of recurrence was an isolated increase in basal dimensions (9/14; 64%). Median (IQR) final logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity of the whole cohort was 0.2 (0.5). The only statistically significant difference in baseline and outcome characteristics between treatment failures and nonfailures was the distance to the fovea (median [IQR], 0.5 [1.3] vs. 2.5 [2.8]; P = 0.002) and final logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (median [IQR], 0.50 [0.80] vs. 0.00 [0.14]; P = 0.002), respectively. Conclusions: Although treatment of small pigmented posterior choroidal melanoma with PDT effectively preserves visual acuity, 5-year treatment-success calculated by Kaplan–Meier analysis was only 38.4%. Recurrences after PDT tend to occur along the tumor edges, often with minimal increase in thickness. Given the substantial risk of treatment failure, primary PDT with vertepofrin is recommended in exceptional cases of choroidal melanoma, for which other treatments with greater tumor control are not a feasible option. © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology"

But recent studies showing normal visual body representation in individuals born without hands challenges the contribution of motor control on visual body representation. Here, we studied hand laterality judgements in three groups with fundamentally different visual and motor hand experiences: two-handed controls, one-handers born without a hand (congenital one-handers) and one-handers with an acquired amputation (amputees). Congenital one-handers, lacking both motor and first-person visual information of their missing hand, diverged in their performance from the other groups, exhibiting more errors for their intact hand and slower reaction-times for challenging hand postures. Amputees, who have lingering non-visual motor control of their missing (phantom) hand, performed the task similarly to controls. Amputees’ reaction-times for visual laterality judgements correlated positively with their phantom hand's motor control, such that deteriorated motor control associated with slower visual laterality judgements. Finally, we have implemented a computational simulation to describe how a mechanism that utilises a single hand representation in congenital one-handers as opposed to two in controls, could replicate our empirical results. Together, our findings demonstrate that motor control is a driver in making visual bodily judgments. © 2019 The Authors
"Lew W.H.; Stevenson S.B.; Coates D.R.";0.0;Stimulus dependence of interocular suppression;2021;Scientific Reports;10.1038/s41598-021-88701-x;Interocular suppression is the phenomenon in which the signal from one eye inhibits the other eye in the presence of dissimilar images. Various clinical and laboratory-based tests have been used to assess suppression, which vary in color, contrast, and stimulus size. These stimulus variations may yield different spatial extents of suppression, which makes it difficult to compare the outcomes. To evaluate the role of stimulus characteristics, we measured the suppression zone using a binocular rivalry paradigm in normally-sighted observers by systematically varying the stimulus parameters. The stimuli consist of a constantly visible horizontal reference seen by one eye while two vertical suppressors were presented to the other eye. With a keypress, the suppressors appeared for 1 s, to induce a transient suppression zone in the middle part of the reference. Subjects adjusted the width between the suppressors to determine the zone. The zone decreased significantly with increasing spatial frequency and lower contrast. The width was 1.4 times larger than the height. The zone was smaller with negative compared to positive contrast polarity but independent of eye dominance, luminance, and colored filters. A departure from scale invariance was captured with a model suggesting a stimulus-dependent and a small fixed non-stimulus-dependent portion. © 2021, The Author(s).

Our objective is to determine whether performance in various neurocognitive tests has an association with itemized retinal nerve fibre layer thickness. Detailed investigation of associations factored in sex and eye-side. The large population-based LIFE-Adult study (Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases) was conducted at Leipzig University, Germany from 2011 to 2014. Randomly selected participants (N 10 000) were drawn from population registry in an age- and gender-stratified manner, focusing on 40-80 years. Cognitive function was examined with the CERAD-NP Plus test-battery (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease), Stroop-Test, Reading the Mind in the Eyes-Test and Multiple-Choice Vocabulary Intelligence Test. Circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was measured with Optical Coherence Tomography. Subjects with reliable measurements (≥50 B-scan repetitions, signal-to-noise-ratio ≥20 dB, ≤5% missing A-scans) and without clinical eye pathology (sample A) and additional exclusion due to conditions of the central nervous system (sample B) were evaluated. The relationship between cognitive function and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was investigated for six segments: temporal, temporal-superior, temporal-inferior, nasal, nasal-superior and nasal-inferior. For comparison with other studies, global mean is given. Brain-side projection analysis links results to the corresponding brain hemisphere. We analysed 11 124 eyes of 6471 subjects [55.5 years of age (19.1-79.8 years), 46.9% male]. Low cognitive performance was predominantly associated with thinner retinal nerve fibre layer thickness. Correlation analysis indicated emphasis on global and temporally located effects. Multivariable regression analysis with adjustments (age, sex and scan radius) presented individual results for each test, differentiating between sex and eye-side. For instance, verbal fluency tests and Trail Making Test-B show stronger association in females; Trail Making Test-A shows right-eye dominance. Findings in Trail-Making-Test-A projected to left brain hemisphere, and the ratio incongruent to neutral in the Stroop test projected to right brain-hemisphere. Separate assessment for sex and eye-side is presented for the first time in a population-based study. Location-specific sectorial retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was found to be an indicator for cognitive performance, giving an option for early detection of cognitive decline and the potential of early treatment. The eye as a window to the brain was studied with optical coherence tomography and connected to cognition. Girbardt et al. report that thinner retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was found to be a meaningful index for poorer cognitive performance which presents the potential for prediction of future cognitive decline.  © The Author(s) (2021)."

Diagnostic and clinical management guidelines are strictly dependent on nature of laterality. This analysis aims to characterize the influence of laterality on survival in patients diagnosed with retinoblastoma. Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for population-based clinical data from 1975 to 2016, a period of 41 years. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression assessed survival with laterality as the primary independent predictor of mortality. Adjustment for demographical and clinical variables was performed. Results: N = 1925 patients with a valid cause of death classification. Mean±SD age was 2.35 ±2.020 years (range 0–74). At the time of diagnosis, 819 (42.1%) patients were between 0 and 1 year of age, 469 (24.1%) patients were between 1 and 2 years, 350 (18.0%) patients were between 2 and 3 years, 147 (7.6%) patients were between 3 and 4 years, and 68 (3.5%) patients were between 4 and 5 years of age. The hazard of univariable cause-specific death is 55.6% and 52.9% lower for retinoblastoma patients with left-sided origin and right-sided origin as compared to patients with bilateral origin, respectively (HR = 0.444, CI 0.247–0.800, p = 0.007; HR = 0.471, CI 0.267–0.832, p = 0.009). After adjusting for confounding variables, the hazard of other-cause death for retinoblastoma patients is significantly less for left-sided origin (HR = 0.364, CI 0.140–0.946, p = 0.038) and right-sided origin (HR = 0.190, CI 0.066–0.549, p = 0.002) as compared to patients with retinoblastomas of bilateral origin. Conclusion: Prognostication of survival is significantly influenced by the nature of laterality in retinoblastoma. Unilateral retinoblastomas showcase increased promise for long-term cause-specific and other-cause survival compared to cases of retinoblastoma arising from bilateral origin. © 2021 Hussain."

The present study compared nocturnal melatonin suppression for light exposures to the superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal retina in one eye independent of shading from the brow and the nose. The stimulus was a 40° diameter luminous disc, half of which was blue light (LED, λpeak = 470 nm) and the other amber light (LED, λpeak = 590 nm). Experimentally, the orientation of the bipartite disc was rotated to each of the four cardinal points of the visual field. A full, 40° blue disc was also employed by replacing the amber half-disc with another blue half-disc. The blue full- and half-discs always produced 100 photopic lx at the cornea. As hypothesized, nocturnal melatonin suppression was statistically greatest when the blue half-disc was delivered to the nasal hemi-field (35%); the other three hemi-fields were equally affected by the blue half-disc (≈20%).

We tested the influence of four viewing conditions (binocular viewing, monocular viewing, binocular viewing with monocular blur, and binocular viewing with binocular blur) on basketball free-throws performance. Methods: Twenty-three male basketball players (19.2 ± 3.4 years) performed 30 free-throws in each viewing condition following a randomised order. Image degradation was induced by the use of Bangerter filters. Complementarily, perceived levels of task load and complexity, as well as visual function were assessed. Results: We found a worse basketball free-throws performance (percentage of successful shots) in the monocular viewing (∼8%) and binocular viewing with monocular blur (∼9%) in comparison to the condition of binocular viewing (corrected p-values = 0.003 and 0.006; and ds = 0.838 and 0.771). The analyses of subjective ratings and visual function allowed us to confirm a successful experimental manipulation. Conclusions: Basketball free-throws performance is subject to the integrity of binocular vision, showing a worse accuracy when the sensory dominant eye was occluded or blurred in comparison to natural (binocular) viewing conditions. However, free-throws performance remains stable when the visual acuity is binocularly degraded. Our findings reveal that an appropriate functioning of the binocular vision is needed for optimal sports performance, and highlight the importance of a comprehensive clinical assessment or management of binocular vision in sport contexts. © 2019, © 2019 European College of Sport Science."
"Steinwurzel C.; Animali S.; Cicchini G.M.; Morrone M.C.; Binda P.";0.0;Using psychophysical performance to predict short-term ocular dominance plasticity in human adults;2020;Journal of Vision;10.1167/JOV.20.7.6;Binocular rivalry has become an important index of visual performance, both to measure ocular dominance or its plasticity, and to index bistable perception. We investigated its interindividual variability across 50 normal adults and found that the duration of dominance phases in rivalry is linked with the duration of dominance phases in another bistable phenomenon (structure from motion). Surprisingly, it also correlates with the strength of center-surround interactions (indexed by the tilt illusion), suggesting a common mechanism supporting both competitive interactions: center-surround and rivalry. In a subset of 34 participants, we further investigated the variability of short-term ocular dominance plasticity, measured with binocular rivalry before and after 2 hours of monocular deprivation. We found that ocular dominance shifts in favor of the deprived eye and that a large portion of ocular dominance variability after deprivation can be predicted from the dynamics of binocular rivalry before deprivation. The single best predictor is the proportion of mixed percepts (phases without dominance of either eye) before deprivation, which is positively related to ocular dominance unbalance after deprivation. Another predictor is the duration of dominance phases, which interacts with mixed percepts to explain nearly 50% of variance in ocular dominance unbalance after deprivation. A similar predictive power is achieved by substituting binocular rivalry dominance phase durations with tilt illusion magnitude, or structure from motion phase durations. Thus, we speculate that ocular dominance plasticity is modulated by two types of signals, estimated from psychophysical performance before deprivation, namely, interocular inhibition (promoting binocular fusion, hence mixed percepts) and inhibition for perceptual competition (promoting longer dominance phases and stronger center-surround interactions). © 2020, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

The potential to boost visual neuroplasticity with environmental enrichment such as exercise has also been explored; however, the results are inconsistent, with some studies ﬁnding no additive eﬀect of exercise. Studies to date have only considered the eﬀect of patching alone or in combination with exercise. Whether exercise alone aﬀects typical outcome measures of experimental estimates of short-term visual neuroplasticity is unknown. We therefore measured binocular rivalry in 20 healthy young adults (20–34 years old) at baseline and after three 2-hour interventions: patching (of the dominant eye) only, patching with exercise, and exercise only. Consistent with previous work, the patching interventions produced a shift in ocular dominance toward the deprived (dominant) eye. Mild-to moderate-intensity exercise in the absence of patching had several eﬀects on binocular rivalry metrics, including a reduction in the dominant eye percept. The proportion of mixed percept and the time to ﬁrst switch (onset rivalry) did not change from baseline across all interventions. Thus, we demonstrate that exercise alone can impact binocular rivalry outcomes measures. We did not observe a synergistic eﬀect between patching and exercise in our data. © 2021"

Aging affects a variety of visual functions. In this study, we aim to quantitatively investigate the temporal characteristics of visual processing in aging. METHODS. Twelve younger (24.1 ± 1.6 years) and 12 older observers (58.4 ± 3.6 years) participated in the study. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The contrast thresholds of the participants were measured using an orientation discrimination task with white external noise masks. The target-mask stimulus onset asynchronies were 16.7 ms, 33.4 ms, 50.0 ms, 83.4 ms, and ∞ (no external noise masks) in separate conditions. The signal stimulus was carefully chosen such that it was equally visible for the younger and older participants. An elaborated perceptual template model (ePTM) was fit to the data of each participant. RESULTS. Without masks, there was no difference in contrast thresholds between the younger and older groups (P = 0.707). With masks, contrast thresholds in the older group elevated more than those in the younger group, and the pattern of threshold elevation differed in the two groups. The ePTM fitted the data well, with the older observers having lower template gains than the younger observers (P = 3.58 × 10−6). A further analysis of the weight parameters of the temporal window revealed that the older observers had a flatter temporal window than the younger observers (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS. Age-related temporal processing deficits were found in older observers with normal contrast sensitivity to the signal stimuli. The deficits were accounted for by the inferior temporal processing window of the visual system in aging. Copyright 2020 The Authors

We introduce a set of dichoptic training tasks that differ in terms of (1) the presence of external noise and (2) the visual feature implicated (motion, orientation), examining the generality of training effects between the different training and test cues and their capacity for driving changes in sensory eye dominance and stereoscopic depth perception. METHODS. We randomly assigned 116 normal-sighted observers to five groups (four training groups and one no training group). All groups completed both pre- and posttests, during which they were tested on dichoptic motion and orientation tasks under noisy and noise-free conditions, as well as a binocular phase combination task and two depth tasks to index sensory eye dominance and binocular function. Training groups received visual training on one of the four dichoptic tasks over 3 consecutive days. RESULTS. Training under noise-free conditions supported generalization of learning to noise-free tasks involving an untrained feature. By contrast, there was a symmetric learning transfer between the signal-noise and no-noise tasks within the same visual feature. Further, training on all tasks reduced sensory eye dominance but did not improve depth perception. CONCLUSIONS. Training-driven changes in sensory eye balance do not depend on the stimulus feature or whether the training entails the presence of external noise. We conjecture that dichoptic visual training acts to balance interocular suppression before or at the site of binocular combination. Copyright 2021 The Authors
"Garrett J.; Bullock T.; Giesbrecht B.";0.0;Tracking the contents of spatial working memory during an acute bout of aerobic exercise;2021;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience;10.1162/jocn_a_01714;Recent studies have reported enhanced visual responses during acute bouts of physical exercise, suggesting that sensory systems may become more sensitive during active exploration of the environment. This raises the possibility that exercise may also modulate brain activity associated with other cognitive functions, like visual working memory, that rely on patterns of activity that persist beyond the initial sensory evoked response. Here, we investigated whether the neural coding of an object location held in memory is modulated by an acute bout of aerobic exercise. Participants performed a spatial change detection task while seated on a stationary bike at rest and during low-intensity cycling (∼50 watts/50 RPM). Brain activity was measured with EEG. An inverted encoding modeling technique was employed to estimate location-selective channel response functions from topographical patterns of alpha-band (8–12 Hz) activity. There was strong evidence of robust spatially selective responses during stimulus presentation and retention periods both at rest and during exercise. During retention, the spatial selectivity of these responses decreased in the exercise condition relative to rest. A temporal generalization analysis indicated that models trained on one time period could be used to reconstruct the remembered locations at other time periods, however, generalization was degraded during exercise. Together, these results demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct the contents of working memory at rest and during exercise, but that exercise can result in degraded responses, which contrasts with the enhancements observed in early sensory processing. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Such dynamics have primarily been studied in the context of rivalry between two percepts, but there is growing interest in the neural mechanisms that drive rivalry between more than two percepts. In recent experiments, we showed that split images presented to each eye lead to subjects perceiving four stochastically alternating percepts (Jacot-Guillarmod et al. Vision research, 133, 37–46, 2017): two single eye images and two interocularly grouped images. Here we propose a hierarchical neural network model that exhibits dynamics consistent with our experimental observations. The model consists of two levels, with the first representing monocular activity, and the second representing activity in higher visual areas. The model produces stochastically switching solutions, whose dependence on task parameters is consistent with four generalized Levelt Propositions, and with experiments. Moreover, dynamics restricted to invariant subspaces of the model demonstrate simpler forms of bistable rivalry. Thus, our hierarchical model generalizes past, validated models of binocular rivalry. This neuromechanistic model also allows us to probe the roles of interactions between populations at the network level. Generalized Levelt’s Propositions hold as long as feedback from the higher to lower visual areas is weak, and the adaptation and mutual inhibition at the higher level is not too strong. Our results suggest constraints on the architecture of the visual system and show that complex visual stimuli can be used in perceptual rivalry experiments to develop more detailed mechanistic models of perceptual processing. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Methods: The data of dominant eye and refractive error of 13 pairs of monozygotic twins who were treated at the Optometry Clinic were collected. The paired chi-square test and Kappa consistency test were used to analyze the data of dominant eye between monozygotic twins, while the paired t test and Pearson correlation analysis were adopted to analyze the refractive error data. SPSS version 22.0 software was used to analyze the above statistics. Results: In the Kappa consistency test of dominant eye between monozygotic twins, Kappa value = 0.451, p = 0.052, p>0.05, and in the paired chi-square test, p = 0.250. In the spherical equivalent paired t test for the right eye of monozygotic twins, t = 1.491 and p = 0.162, while in the spherical equivalent paired t test for the left eye, t = 0.753 and p = 0.466. In the spherical equivalent correlation analysis of monozygotic twins, for the spherical equivalent refraction of the right eye, the Pearson correlation results were r = 0.901 and p = 0.00, and for the spherical equivalent refraction of the left eye, the Pearson correlation results were r = 0.971 and p = 0.00. Conclusion: The difference in the chi-square test of dominant eye is not statistically significant between monozygotic twins, but dominant eye and refractive error are correlated to some extent. It is suggested that heredity may be the main determinant of the dominant eye. There is no difference in refractive error between identical twins which are highly correlated, however. © 2021 Jiang et al.

METHODS: This prospective comparative study of consecutive eligible patients with presbyopic hyperopia undergoing a bilateral presbyopic laser in situ keratomileusis technique was conducted between January 2018 and February 2019. After contact lens-simulated monovision measurements were obtained, the non-dominant eyes had a negative aspheric ablation profile planned using the Custom-Q nomogram (Alcon Laboratories, Inc). The dominant eye was operated on with a positive aspheric ablation profile. Visual acuity testing, refraction, corneal asphericity (DQ), higher order aberrations, and a satisfaction questionnaire (National Eye Institute Refractive Error Quality of Life) were evaluated after the monovision trial and postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients, with a mean age of 56.03 ± 4.31 years, were included in the study. At 6 months, 100% of patients achieved 20/20 or better binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) versus 57% in the monovision group, 100% of patients achieved 20/25 or better binocular uncorrected intermediate visual acuity versus 32% in the monovision group, and 92.86% of patients achieved 20/25 or better binocular uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) in both groups. In contact lens monovision simulation, no patient reached a UDVA of 20/50 or better, with only 3.6% having a UNVA of 20/40 or better. The questionnaire demonstrated high patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes confirm the superiority of increased depth of focus using negative spherical aberration modulation in the non-dominant eye compared with contact lens monovision. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of positive spherical aberration induction to improve intermediate and near vision in the dominant eye. © 2021 Slack Incorporated. All rights reserved.

All participants wore the Eyelike Pinhole II in the non-dominant eye for >3 h/day for a period of 1 week. Binocular and monocular uncorrected near visual acuities, distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity, and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were measured before and after the intervention. All visual acuities were measured in logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) units. In addition, binocular defocus curves were generated, and contrast sensitivity values were obtained under photopic and mesopic conditions before and after lens wear. Results: The mean DCNVA of the treated eye and the mean binocular DCNVA improved from 0.34 ± 0.12 to 0.15 ± 0.14 (P < 0.001) and 0.31 ± 0.13 to 0.11 ± 0.10 (P < 0.001) logMAR, respectively, after pinhole contact lens wear. Although the mean CDVA of the treated eye deteriorated from −0.04 ± 0.05 to 0.02 ± 0.11 logMAR (P = 0.015), there was no significant change in the mean binocular CDVA (P = 0.79). The binocular defocus curve showed a significant improvement from −5.0 dioptres (D) to −1.0 D after pinhole contact lens wear. Conclusions: The newly developed Eyelike Pinhole II soft contact lens showed safe and effective outcomes; thus, it could be a promising option for the treatment of presbyopia. © 2019 British Contact Lens Association"

Evidence suggests higher cognitive processes prioritize visual over nonvisual stimuli during divided attention. Visual stimuli should thus be disproportionally distracting when processing incongruent cross-sensory stimulus pairs.We tested this assumption by comparing visual processing with olfaction, a ""primitive"" sensory channel that detects potentially hazardous chemicals by alerting attention. Behavioral and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were assessed in a bimodal object categorization task with congruent or incongruent odor-picture pairings and a delayed auditory target that indicated whether olfactory or visual cues should be categorized. For congruent pairings, accuracy was higher for visual compared to olfactory decisions. However, for incongruent pairings, reaction times (RTs) were faster for olfactory decisions. Behavioral results suggested that incongruent odors interfered more with visual decisions, thereby providing evidence for an ""olfactory dominance"" effect. Categorization of incongruent pairings engendered a late ""slow wave"" ERP effect. Importantly, this effect had a later amplitude peak and longer latency during visual decisions, likely ref lecting additional categorization effort for visual stimuli in the presence of incongruent odors. In sum, contrary to what might be inferred from theories of ""visual dominance,"" incongruent odors may in fact uniquely attract mental processing resources during perceptual incongruence. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

In experiment 1, we systematically added linear perspective cues and texture gradients in a background image of the corridor illusion. To determine whether perceptual size rescaling takes place at earlier or later stages, we tested how the perceived size of top and bottom rings changed under binocular (rings and background presented to both eyes), monocular (rings and background presented to the dominant eye only), and dichoptic (rings and background presented separately to the dominant and nondominant eyes, respectively) viewing conditions. We found differences between viewing conditions in the perceived size of the rings when linear perspective cues, but not texture gradients, were presented. Specifically, linear perspective cues produced a stronger illusion under the monocular compared to the dichoptic viewing condition. Hence, there was partial interocular transfer from the linear perspective cues, suggesting a dominant role of monocular neural populations in mediating the corridor illusion. In experiment 2, we repeated similar procedures with a more traditional Ponzo illusion background. Contrary to findings from experiment 1, there was a full interocular transfer with the presence of the converging lines, suggesting a dominant role of binocular neural populations. We conclude that higher order visual areas, which contain binocular neural populations, are more involved in the perceptual rescaling of size evoked by linear perspective cues in the Ponzo compared to the corridor illusion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

The stimuli consisted of unisensory and multisensory presentations of the letters ‘b’ and ‘d’. The multisensory stimuli were either congruent (e.g., the grapheme ‘b’ with the phoneme /b/) or incongruent (e.g., the grapheme ‘b’ with the phoneme /d/). In the detection task, the participants had to respond to all of the stimuli as rapidly as possible while, in the discrimination task, they only responded on those trials where one prespecified letter (either ‘b’ or ‘d’) was present. Incongruent multisensory stimuli resulted in faster responses as compared to unisensory stimuli in the detection task. In the discrimination task, only the dual-target congruent stimuli resulted in faster RTs, while the incongruent multisensory stimuli led to slower RTs than to unisensory stimuli; RTs were the slowest when the visual (rather than the auditory) signal was irrelevant, thus suggesting visual dominance. Switch costs were also observed when switching between unisensory target stimuli, while dual-target multisensory stimuli were less likely to be affected by sensory switching. Taken together, these findings suggest that multisensory motor enhancements and sensory switch costs are influenced by top–down modulations determined by task instructions, which can override the influence of prior learnt associations. © 2021, The Author(s)."
"Hwang B.-W.; Schütz A.C.";0.0;Idiosyncratic preferences in transparent motion and binocular rivalry are dissociable;2020;Journal of Vision;10.1167/jov.20.12.3;"Previous studies revealed that there are idiosyncratic preferences to perceive certain motion directions in front during motion transparency depth rivalry (Mamassian & Wallace, 2010; Schütz, 2014). Meanwhile, other studies reported idiosyncratic preferences in binocular rivalry during the onset stage (Carter & Cavanagh, 2007; Stanley, Carter, & Forte, 2011). Here we investigated the relationship of idiosyncratic preferences in transparent motion and binocular rivalry. We presented two dot clouds that were moving in opposite directions. In the transparent motion condition, both dot clouds were presented to both eyes and participants had to report the dot cloud they perceived in front. In the binocular rivalry condition, the dot clouds were presented to different eyes and participants had to report the dominant dot cloud. There were strong idiosyncratic directional preferences in transparent motion and rather weak directional preferences in binocular rivalry. In general, binocular rivalry was dominated by biases in contrast polarity, whereas transparent motion was dominated by biases in motion direction. A circular correlation analysis showed no correlation between directional preferences in transparent motion and binocular rivalry. These findings show that idiosyncratic preferences in a visual feature can be dissociated at different stages of processing. © 2020 Copyright 2020 The Authors"

Producing and understanding language, for instance, engages the left hemisphere to a larger extent than the right in most people. Recent research showed that lateralization for auditory word processing increases with age. The present study extends these findings to the visual domain. We measured lateralization for visual word processing with the visual half field task in young (20–30 years) and older participants (70–80 years). The older cohort had a larger right visual field advantage in terms of reaction time (p =.016, dolder adults = 0.16, dyounger adults = 0.13) and accuracy (p =.053, dolder adults = 0.73, dyounger adults = 0.25). This difference was mainly driven by a weaker performance for words presented in the left visual field. Our findings suggest that hemisphere dominance for language increases with aging. Alternatively, the findings could be explained by delayed inter-hemispheric communication in older adults. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effect of decreased viewing distance on detected subjective refraction remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of viewing distance on the assessment of subjective refraction. Two types of subjective refraction of the dominant eye were determined in 45 participants at five viewing distances (6 m, 5 m, 4 m, 3 m, and 2.5 m): subjective refraction that ensured visual acuity 1.0 (in decimal units) and maximum subjective refraction that ensured the best corrected visual acuity. The results demonstrated that viewing distance significantly affected the outcome of subjective refraction detection; there were hyperopic shifts in all types of refractions that increased as the viewing distance decreased. To conclude, the most appropriate viewing distance for subjective refraction detection is 5 m or 6 m. If viewing distance is reduced to 4 m or less, a negative spherical lens of the corresponding proximity should be added to the obtained subjective refraction as it cannot be reliably stated that ocular accommodation is fully relaxed. Since this is not always achievable by 0.25 D steps, mirror systems should be used in smaller (3 m and closer viewing distances) optometric offices to provide more appropriate subjective refraction detection. © 2021 Authors."

The ethnic differences in the Asian upper eyelid anatomy are compounded by the technical challenges of primary and revision ptosis correction. The authors present a technique of upper eyelid ptosis correction that estimates the exact location of suture fixation that uses the musculoaponeurotic junction of the levator as the reference point. The preoperative considerations in determining the fixation point relative to the musculoaponeurotic junction include the following: A, the extent of ptosis correction needed; B, the degree of compensatory brow elevation with eye opening; and C, eye dominance. The benefits of this approach are the shortened operative time because of more precise preoperative planning and greater predictability and reproducibility of the results. The authors have found that this technique produced consistent and superior results for ptosis correction in Asian patients. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved."

Traditionally, biological psychiatry has asked how compounds affect the causal pathways of illness to reduce symptoms and therefore focus on analysis of the pharmacologic properties. In psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP), there is debate about whether ingestion of the psychedelic alone is thought to be responsible for the clinical outcome. A question arises how the medication and psychotherapeutic intervention together might lead to neurobiological changes that underlie recovery from illness such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This paper offers a framework for investigating the neurobiological basis of PAP by extrapolating from models used to explain how a pharmacologic intervention might create an optimal brain state during which environmental input has enduring effects. Specifically, there are developmental “critical” periods (CP) with exquisite sensitivity to environmental input; the biological characteristics are largely unknown. We discuss a hypothesis that psychedelics may remove the brakes on adult neuroplasticity, inducing a state similar to that of neurodevelopment. In the visual system, progress has been made both in identifying the biological conditions which distinguishes the CP and in manipulating the active ingredients with the idea that we might pharmacologically reopen a critical period in adulthood. We highlight ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the visual system as a model for characterizing CP in limbic systems relevant to psychiatry. A CP framework may help to integrate the neuroscientific inquiry with the influence of the environment both in development and in PAP. © Copyright © 2021 Lepow, Morishita and Yehuda."

The sensory dominance effect refers to the phenomenon that stimuli from one sensory modality are preferentially selected over the other modalities. Top-down attention helps us to select task-relevant information while filtering out task-irrelevant distracting information. To investigate how top-down attention towards one specific modality modulates the sensory dominance effect, we incorporated the endogenous cue-target paradigm and an adapted version of the Colavita paradigm in the present study. The visual responses could either precede or fall behind the auditory responses, i.e., the visual vs. auditory precedence trials. The direction of the sensory dominance was defined as the proportion of the visual vs. auditory precedence bimodal trials, and the magnitude of the sensory dominance was calculated as the difference in reaction times between the first and the second responses in the bimodal trials. Results from the present three experiments consistently showed that when attention was voluntarily directed to the visual modality, the visual dominance occurred more frequently than the auditory dominance, and the magnitude of the visual dominance was significantly larger than the auditory dominance. This pattern of results was independent of the delivery modality of the cue. The present results thus provide direct empirical evidence showing that endogenous attention towards one specific sensory modality modulates both the direction and the size of sensory dominance. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Given that the image is presented in front of only one eye, the two eyes are not stimulated in the same way and it can create a phenomenon known as binocular rivalry. It appears when the brain is not able to merge the two visuals information and an alternation between them can occur. This alternation is dependent on visual condition and the question arises as is it relevant to choose the eye to display the image to limit binocular rivalry and guarantee a good performance in the tasks of recognition and control. Our study aims to compare the performances as a function of the position of the virtual image. These results are then compared to the results of several dominant eye tests to determine if one test can objectively determine on which eye the monocular information should be displayed when using a monocular see-through device.  © 2020 SPIE.
"Ooi T.L.; He Z.J.";0.0;Sensory eye dominance: Relationship between eye and brain;2020;Eye and Brain;10.2147/EB.S176931;Eye dominance refers to the preference to use one eye more than the fellow eye to accomplish a task. However, the dominant eye revealed can be task dependent especially when the tasks are as diverse as instructing the observer to sight a target through a ring, or to report which half-image is perceived more of during binocular rivalry stimulation. Conventionally, the former task is said to reveal motor eye dominance while the latter task reveals sensory eye dominance. While the consensus is that the motor and sensory-dominant eye could be different in some observers, the reason for it is still unclear and has not been much researched. This review mainly focuses on advances made in recent studies of sensory eye dominance. It reviews studies conducted to quantify and relate sensory eye dominance to other visual functions, in particular to stereopsis, as well as studies conducted to explore its plasticity. It is recognized that sensory eye dominance in observers with clinically normal vision shares some similarity with amblyopia at least at the behavioral level, in that both exhibit an imbalance of interocular inhibition. Furthermore, sensory eye dominance is probably manifested at multiple sites along the visual pathway, perhaps including the level of ocular dominance columns. But future studies with high-resolution brain imaging approaches are required to confirm this speculation in the human visual system. © 2020 Ooi and He.

Material:50 highly skilled female boxers (masters of sports of international class, masters of sports). The study of female boxer psychomotor functions was designed according to a certain scheme. The motor component of motor response was examined by means of tapping test. The time of a simple and two complex visual-motor responses was determined. The study was completed by determining the identification time for visual stimuli of various degrees of complexity without a motor response. It was assumed that this will allow to consider the visual-gnostic component in a “pure” form. Such a design of the study permitted to evaluate the contribution of each component of psychomotor response to the response speed of female boxers with different types of functional hemispheric asymmetry (FHA) profile. Results:the right hand of the right-handers was found to be significantly faster than that of left-handers and, especially, ambidexters. The left hand speed of the right-handers is almost the same as that of the left-handers, whereas in ambidexters it is significantly higher. The right-handers appear to be faster during realization of complex visual-motor response than both the left-handers and ambidexters. As for the asymmetry of the legs, it is not possible to talk about the relationship between the lateralization character and the speed of the choice time. Among most of athletes the right-legged (60.0%) and the left-legged (75.0%) were in the group with a high speed of response. Conclusions:A comparison of the responses to the stimulus of the two alternatives shows that the right hand of right-handers is significantly faster than that of the left-handers and, especially, ambidexters. The speed of the left hand of the right-handers is almost the same as that of the left hand of the left-handers, and only in ambidexters it is much higher. Comparison of the responses to the stimulus of the three alternatives indicates that both the right hand and the left hand of the right-handers are significantly faster than those of athletes of the other two groups.Right-handers tend to be faster than left-handers and ambidexters during realization of a complex visual-motor response. The time of complex response in highly skilled female boxers is associated with visual lateralization. Athletes with the right dominant eye are more “speedy”. © JPES.

(2016) showed that amblyopic eye’s visual acuity per se after 2 months of occlusion therapy could be predicted by a homeostatic plasticity, that is, the temporary shift of perceptual eye dominance observed after a 2-h monocular deprivation, in children with anisometropic amblyopia. In this study, we assess whether the visual acuity improvement of the amblyopic eye measured after 2 months of occlusion therapy could be predicted by this plasticity. Methods: Seven children (6.86 ± 1.46 years old; SD) with anisometropic amblyopia participated in this study. All patients were newly diagnosed and had no treatment history before participating in our study. They finished 2 months of refractive adaptation and then received a 4-h daily fellow eye patching therapy with an opaque patch for a 2-month period. Best-corrected visual acuity of the amblyopic eye was measured before and after the patching therapy. The homeostatic plasticity was assessed by measuring the temporary shift of perceptual eye dominance from 2-h occlusion of the amblyopic eye before treatment. A binocular phase combination paradigm was used for this study. Results: We found that there was no significant correlation between the temporary shift of perceptual eye dominance observed after 2-h occlusion of the amblyopic eye and the improvement in visual acuity in the amblyopic eye from 2 months of classical patching therapy. This result, although in disagreements with the conclusions of Lunghi et al. involving the short-term patching of the amblyopic eye, is in fact consistent with a reanalysis of Lunghi and colleagues’ data. Conclusion: The short-term changes in perceptual eye dominance as a result of short-term monocular deprivation do not provide an index of cortical plasticity in the general sense such that they are able to predict acuity outcomes from longer-term classical patching. © Copyright © 2020 Tao, He, Chen, Zhou and Hess."

To study binocular balance by comparing dichoptic and standard monocular contrast sensitivity function (CSF) in stereonormal and stereoanomalous/stereoblind amblyopic subjects. METHODS. Sixteen amblyopes and 17 controls participated. Using the capability of the passive three-dimensional display, we measured their CSF both monocularly and dichoptically at spatial frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 cpds using achromatic Gabor patches on a luminance noise background. During monocular stimulation, the untested eye was covered, while for the dichoptic stimulation the untested eye viewed background noise. Dichoptic CSF of both eyes was acquired within one block. RESULTS. In patients with central fixation, dichoptic viewing had a large negative impact on the CSF of the amblyopic eye, although it hardly affected that of the dominant eye. In contrast, dichoptic viewing had a small but significant effect on both eyes for controls. In addition, all participants lay along a continuum in terms of how much their two eyes were affected by dichoptic stimulation: by using two predefined contrast sensitivity ratios, namely, amblyopic sensitivity decrement and dichoptic sensitivity decrement, not only did we find a significant correlation between these variables among all participants, but also the two groups were identified with minimum error using a cluster analysis. CONCLUSIONS. Dichoptic CSF may be considered to measure visual performance in patients with altered binocular vision, because it better reflects the visual capacity of the amblyopic eye than the standard monocular examinations. It may also be a more reliable parameter to assess the efficacy of modern approaches to treat amblyopia. © 2020 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.. All rights reserved.

The current study aimed to systematically investigate glare sensitivity in the central and peripheral visual fields by measuring contrast sensitivity function (CSF) under nonglare, steady glare, and transient glare conditions. Nine observers with normal visual acuity in the dominant eye were enrolled. The CSF in central and peripheral vision (the 5° upper left visual field) was measured in a mesopic environment while the stimulus was displayed under three conditions: nonglare, steady glare, and transient glare. An orientation identification task was used to obtain the CSF. After the experiment, the observers were asked to report their level of discomfort in the presence of the glare. The area under the log CSF (AULCSF) and cut-off spatial frequency served as indicators of visual performance. In agreement with previous studies, both steady and transient glare reduced the AULCSF and cut-off frequency. However, the AULCSF and cut-off frequency were reduced more for central vision than for nearly peripheral vision. In addition, the extent of the decreases in the AULCSF and cut-off frequency was greater for steady glare than for transient glare; in contrast, more discomfort was associated with transient glare than steady glare. © The Author(s) 2020."

Methods: This was a retrospective interventional case series where children (≤18 years) with RRD and severe PVR (grade C) were included. All eyes underwent PPV with ILM peeling up to 2-disk diameter beyond the vascular arcades. The main outcome measures were assessment of feasibility of ILM peeling in the pediatric RRD and evaluation of the rate of complete retinal reattachment and corrected-distance visual acuity (CDVA) at the final follow-up. Results: A total of 29 eyes (25 patients) were enrolled in this study. ILM peeling performed on these children was not more difficult than in adult eyes. After a mean follow-up of 18 months, the patients achieved final CDVA better than 20/200 in 37.9%. The initial retinal reattachment was 55.2% while the final anatomical success was 86.2%. Conclusion: Vitrectomy with ILM peeling is technically feasible in pediatric RRD, limiting epiretinal proliferation and achieving favorable anatomical outcomes in cases of complex pediatric RRD. The long-term effects of ILM peeling need further investigation. © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.

This phenomenon was consistently observed during the phase of fast free flight rotations and was marked by a prolonged and complete suppression of nystagmus and gaze stabilizing ""environment referenced eye movements""(EREM; such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex, optokinetic reflex, smooth pursuit and others). Instead, these eye movements were coupled with intersegmental body movements. We have therefore called it ""spinal motor-coupled eye movements""(SCEM) and have interpreted the phenomenon to likely be caused by anti-compensatory functions of more proprioceptive mediated reflexes and perhaps other mechanisms (e.g., top-down regulation as part of a motor plan) to effectively cope with a new-orientation in space, undisturbed by EREM functions. In the phase before landing, the phenomenon was replaced again by the known gaze-stabilizing EREM functions. The present study specifically evaluated long-term measures of vestibulo- ocular reflex functions (VOR) in high level gymnasts and controls during both passively driven monoaxial rotations and context-specific multiaxial somersault simulations in a vestibular lab. This approach provided further insights into the possible roles of adaptive or mental influences concerning the VOR function and how they are associated with the described phenomenon of SCEM. Results showed high inter-individual variability of VOR function in both gymnasts and controls, but no systematic adaptation of the VOR in gymnasts, neither compared to controls nor over a period of three years. This might generally support the hypothesis that the phenomenon of SCEM might indeed be driven more by proprioceptively mediated and situationally dominant eye movement functions than by adaptative processes of the VOR. © 2020 von Laßberg et al."

Methods and Analysis Retrospective study including 96 eyes with RRD (34 macula-on and 62 macula-off) repaired between June 2012 and March 2020. The final visual acuity (VA) was compared after the patients were divided by the status of the macula and their DMD. Results The mean final VA of patients with macula-on RRD (group A) was logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) 0.04±0.07, which was not statistically different from that of individuals with macula-off RRD with DMD ≤3 days (group B; logMAR 0.05±0.06) (p=0.79). There were statistically significant differences in the final VA between group A and patients with macula-off RRD with DMD of 4-7 days (group C; logMAR 0.15±0.15) (p=0.017) as well as between group A and those with macula-off RRD with DMD ≥8 days (group D; logMAR 0.36±0.29) (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the final VA between group B and C (p=0.33). Conclusion The mean final VA of patients with macula-on RRD was comparable to that of the macula-off patients with DMD ≤3 days. Our findings suggest that if macula-on RRD could not be immediately repaired, a repair within 72 hours may result in similar outcomes, even if the macula detaches within that time frame. However, once the macula detaches, we do not observe statistically significant differences in outcome for repairs done within 7 days.  © "

Methods: A total of 34 subjects with intermittent exotropia were enrolled. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was performed after discrimination of the dominant eye using a prism cover test (PCT). FAZ widths in the superficial capillary plexus (referred to here as superficial FAZ or SFAZ) and in the deep capillary plexus (deep FAZ or DFAZ); VDs of the 1-mm fovea and 3-mm parafovea, specifically the superficial capillary plexus density (SCPD); and CT measured by OCTA were compared between both eyes using a one-sample t-test. These abovementioned parameters were compared between dominant and non-dominant eyes through Pearson’s correlation analysis. Results: The widths of SFAZ and DFAZ, the 1-mm fovea and 3-mm parafovea SCPDs, and CT of dominant eye showed positive correlations with respect to the non-dominant eye. Although there was no statistically significant difference in SFAZ and DFAZ widths, the 3-mm parafovea SCPD, or CT between eyes, the 1-mm fovea SCPD in the non-dominant eye showed a statistically significant higher density than that of the dominant eye (p = 0.039).

To evaluate the clinical outcome of blended vision combined with micromonovision (MMBV) using a + 4 diopter (D) addition power (add) diffractive intraocular lens (MIOL) and a + 2.75 D add MIOL with a myopic target of -0.5 D. Methods. One hundred twenty eyes of 60 cases were enrolled. The +4 D add MIOLs were placed in the nondominant eye, the +2.75 D add MIOLs were placed in the dominant eye with a myopic target of -0.5 D in 30 cases (the MMBV group), and the +4 D add MIOLs were placed in both eyes in another 30 cases (controls). Postoperative clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results. Compared with the controls, binocular uncorrected intermediate vision at 70 cm was significantly better in the MMBV group (p=0.02). Contrast sensitivity at 12 cycles per degree and the 6% and 12.5% low-contrast visual acuities were also significantly better in the MMBV group compared with the controls (p values = 0.05, 0.05, and 0.04, respectively).

"Wang M.; McGraw P.; Ledgeway T.";0.0;Attentional eye selection modulates sensory eye dominance;2021;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2021.06.006;Brief periods of monocular deprivation significantly modify binocular visual processing. For example, patching one eye for a few hours alters the inter-ocular balance, with the previously patched eye becoming dominant once the patch is removed. However, the contribution of higher-level visual processing to this phenomenon is still unclear. Here, we compared changes in sensory eye dominance produced by three types of monocular manipulations in adult participants with normal binocular vision. One eye was covered for 150 min using either an opaque patch, a diffusing lens, or a prism that inverted the image. All three manipulations altered dominance duration and predominance during binocular rivalry (BR) in favour of the treated eye and the time courses of the changes were similar. These results indicate that modifications of luminance or contrast are not strictly necessary to drive shifts in eye dominance, as both were unaltered in the prism condition. Next, we found that shifts in eye dominance were dependent on attentional demands during the monocular treatment period, providing support for the role of attentional eye selection in modulating eye dominance. Finally, we found relatively rapid build-up of the ocular dominance shift after the onset of monocular treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that modifications to monocular input alter inter-ocular balance via selective attentional mechanisms that bias output towards the deprived eye. Eye-based attention may play an important role in conditions where normal input to one eye is disrupted, such as childhood amblyopia. © 2021

Two samples of schizophrenia patients, the first a sample of 34 right-handers and 42 left-handers and a replication set of 84 right-handers, were examined with regard to age at onset considering handedness and the four Luria’s signs (arm folding, hand clasping, familial sinistrality and eye dominance) as well as gender. The association between these parameters and age at onset was investigated by means of multiple regression analysis. Our analyses revealed that right-handers with right arm folding and left-handers with left arm folding showed an early age at onset, while in the late age at onset the opposite preferences prevailed. Apart from arm folding, signs of ambilaterality, i.e., left eye dominance in right-handers and familial sinistrality in left-handers were additional predictors for an early age at onset. Remarkably, all observations found in the first right-handed sample were confirmed in the right-handed replication set. We conclude that among the many different factors specific lateral preferences should also be considered in assessing patients who are at risk of psychosis. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Our visual system compares the inputs received from the two eyes to estimate the relative depths of features in the retinal image. We investigated how an imbalance in the strength of the input received from the two eyes affects stereopsis. We also explored the level of agreement between different measurements of sensory eye imbalance. METHODS. We measured the sensory eye imbalance and stereoacuity of 30 normally sighted participants. We made our measurements using a modified amblyoscope. The sensory eye imbalance was assessed through three methods: the difference between monocular contrast thresholds, the difference in dichoptic masking weight, and the contribution of each eye to a fused binocular percept. We referred them as the “threshold imbalance,” “masking imbalance,” and “fusion imbalance,” respectively. The stereoacuity threshold was measured by having subjects discriminate which of four circles were displaced in depth. All of our tests were performed using stimuli of the same spatial frequency (2.5 cycles/degree). RESULTS. We found a relationship between stereoacuity and sensory eye imbalance. However, this was only the case for fusion imbalance measurement (ρ = 0.52; P = 0.003). Neither the threshold imbalance nor the masking imbalance was significantly correlated with stereoacuity. We also found the threshold imbalance was correlated with both the fusion and masking imbalances (r = 0.46, P = 0.011 and r = 0.49, P = 0.005, respectively). However, a nonsignificant correlation was found between the fusion and masking imbalances. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings suggest that there exist multiple types of sensory eye dominance that can be assessed by different tasks. We find only imbalances in dominance that result in biases to fused percepts are correlated with stereoacuity. Copyright 2021 The Authors"

To investigate the incidence and clinical characteristics of paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) and its relationship with prominent middle limiting membrane (p-MLM) sign in eyes with retinal artery occlusion (RAO) or retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in a Chinese clinical setting. Methods. In this retrospective observational study from January 2015 to May 2020, multimodal imaging data of 807 eyes including 555 consecutive patients with RVO or 252 consecutive patients with RAO were reviewed. All patients were scanned using the spectrum-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and some of them underwent color fundus photography, fundus fluorescence angiography, en face OCT, and OCT angiography. Results. PAMM was detected in 49 eyes of 49 RAO patients and 29 eyes of 29 RVO patients. The mean ages at presentation were 64.49 ± 13.90 years and 54.00 ± 18.48 years in RAO and RVO patients (P=0.006), respectively. Eyes with RAO were more prone to develop PAMM (19.44% [49/252] vs. 5.23% [29/555]; P<0.001). Of the 78 eyes with PAMM, 24 eyes (7 eyes with RVO and 17 eyes with RAO) were found with p-MLM sign. An interesting phenomenon that had been overlooked before was that the hyperreflective line of the p-MLM sign was usually continuous, regardless of the type of PAMM lesion. Conclusions. This series is the largest to date to describe the clinical characteristics of PAMM and p-MLM sign in Chinese patients. The incidence of PAMM and p-MLM sign in patients with RAO was relatively higher than that in patients with RVO. These signs alone probably represent milder ischemia and prompt us to carry out a comprehensive and meticulous examination to prevent the further development of the disease. In addition, the hyperreflective line of the p-MLM sign was usually continuous, which could support the totally venous nature of the retinal deep capillary plexus to some extent.  © 2021 Zhengwei Zhang et al."

Methods: A total of 14 eyes of 7 healthy contact lens users (mean age 28.6 ± 8.5 years) were recruited. The “Light Disturbance Analyser” device was employed for light characterization. The selected lenses were the monthly disposable “Biofinity multifocal” (CooperVision, CA, USA), both centre-distance and centre-near designs (addition power +2.50 D). Two circular pupils of 3 mm and 5 mm of diameter, and an elliptical shape (3 horizontal and 5 vertical mm) were used. Metrics such as the light distortion index (LDI), best-fit circle radius and its irregularity were analysed, among others. Results: The LDI was generally higher with multifocal lenses, varying from 3.7 ± 0.3 % of the single vision lens to 6.1 ± 3.3 % of the multifocal centre-distance design and the 5-mm pupil. Larger pupils gave higher LDI values, changing from 4.5 ± 2.0 % (3 mm) to 6.1 ± 3.3 % (5 mm) with the centre-distance design. The elliptical pupil produced the largest discrepancy in the distortion size between the vertical and horizontal directions. The centre-distance and centre-near designs behaved similarly in terms of light distortion. Conclusions: The multifocal contact lenses of the study increased light distortion effects under low light conditions, especially with larger pupils. The shape of the distortion pattern is associated with the shape of the pupil. It seems that not all, but a big percentage of light distortion would be produced by the presence of the out-of-focus images given by a multifocal lens. © 2019 British Contact Lens Association

Inadequate optical correction results in additional load on the accommodation system of the eye, increased fatigue, and complaints of asthenopia. Full optical correction is an essential requirement for the correct functioning of a visual analyzer. However, if baseline impairments of accommodation response (fusion) are not considered, full optical correction (eyeglasses or contact lenses) provokes visual discomfort. Daily disposable contact lenses (CL) with power change for each additional month is helpful in these cases, thereby allowing for a stepwise transition to the complete correction of ametropias and recovery of physiological accommodation, convergence, and better central and binocular vision quality. Prescription of spherical (not toric) CL, whose optical power was calculated by the spherical equivalent of sphero-cylindrical correction, is a typical error when correcting low astigmatism. This error negatively affects accommodative response and visual working capacity. A complete correction of astigmatism (even a low one) is required for visual recovery to reduce visual fatigue and improve working capacity and academic performance. When prescribing optical correction, binocular vision patterns and a dominant eye should be considered. © 2021, Medicine-Inform LLC. All rights reserved.
Valuch C.;0.0;Color can shorten breakthrough times in continuous flash suppression through increased salience and task relevance;2021;Vision (Switzerland);10.3390/VISION5010013;Color can enhance the perception of relevant stimuli by increasing their salience and guiding visual search towards stimuli that match a task-relevant color. Using Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS), the current study investigated whether color facilitates the discrimination of targets that are difficult to perceive due to interocular suppression. Gabor patterns of two or four cycles per degree (cpd) were shown as targets to the non-dominant eye of human participants. CFS masks were presented at a rate of 10 Hz to the dominant eye, and participants had the task to report the target’s orientation as soon as they could discriminate it. The 2-cpd targets were robustly suppressed and resulted in much longer response times compared to 4-cpd targets. Moreover, only for 2-cpd targets, two color-related effects were evident. First, in trials where targets and CFS masks had different colors, targets were reported faster than in trials where targets and CFS masks had the same color. Second, targets with a known color, either cyan or yellow, were reported earlier than targets whose color was randomly cyan or yellow. The results suggest that the targets’ entry to consciousness may have been speeded by color-mediated effects relating to increased (bottom-up) salience and (top-down) task relevance. © 2021 by the author.

It assesses the ability of the eyes to converge at short distances. Although the test consists of a pure symmetrical vergence task, small involuntary saccades occur concurrently. The main goal of this study was to analyze saccadic characteristics as a function of vergence demand when testing the near point of convergence. To this purpose, the eye movements of 11 participants were registered with an eye-tracker while they performed the near point of convergence test by following a target that traveled forward and backward on a motorized bench. Saccade amplitude increased and, on average, saccade rate decreased with vergence demand. In general, the direction of the concurrent vergence movement had no significant effect on saccade characteristics. However, each individual subject showed idiosyncratic behavior. Most saccades tended to be corrective in terms of both binocular disparity and individual fixation position errors. In particular, most participants tended to correct the fixation position error of the dominant eye. © 2021 The Author(s)
"Ramamurthy M.; Blaser E.";0.0;The ups and downs of sensory eye balance: Monocular deprivation has a biphasic effect on interocular dominance;2021;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2021.01.010;Classic studies of ocular dominance plasticity in early development showed that monocular deprivation suppresses the neural representation and visual function of the deprived eye. However, recent studies have shown that a short period of monocular deprivation (<3 h) in normal adult humans, shifts sensory eye dominance in favor of the deprived eye. How can these opposing effects be reconciled? Here we argue that there are two systems acting in opposition at different time scales. A fast acting, stabilizing, homeostatic system that rapidly decreases gain in the non-deprived eye or increases gain in the deprived eye, and a relatively sluggish system that shifts balance toward the non-deprived eye, in an effort to reduce input of little utility to active vision. If true, then continuous deprivation should produce a biphasic effect on interocular balance, first shifting balance away from the non-deprived eye, then towards it. Here we investigated the time course of the deprivation effect by monocularly depriving typical adults for 10 h and conducting tests of sensory eye balance at six intervening time points. Consistent with previous short-term deprivation work, we found shifts in sensory eye dominance away from the non-deprived eye up until approximately 5 h. We then observed a turning point, with balance shifting back towards the non-deprived eye, -, a biphasic effect. We argue that this turning point marks where the rapid homeostatic response saturates and is overtaken by the slower system responsible for suppressing monocular input of limited utility. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

It is found that the nonlinear combination of image quality contribution information exists, and the eye dominance has no significant effect on the results.

Ocular dominance, also known as eye dominance, is one type of laterality in that eye dominance affects human visual perception. This study explores how ocular human laterality is associated with decision making in determining one choice from the left or right and top or bottom. Two simple tasks are developed running in a virtual environment in which a user wears a head-mounted display and observes two 3D ball shape objects that one moves to the left and the other moves to the right side of their eyes. The user performs the same task as the direction of the ball movement is changed to up and down. An eye-tracking device is used to measure the users’ decision on the two tasks by tracking down their eye movements. A user study conducted with a total of 20 college students, ages ranged from 18 to 30 years old, revealed that there was a significant relationship between eye dominance and their decision making. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
"Foutch B.K.; Bassi C.J.";0.0;The dominant eye: Dominant for parvo-but not for magno-biased stimuli?;2020;Vision (Switzerland);10.3390/vision4010019;Eye dominance is often defined as a preference for the visual input of one eye to the other. Implicit in this definition is the dominant eye has better visual function. Several studies have investigated the effect of visual direction or defocus on ocular dominance, but there is less evidence connecting ocular dominance and monocular visual thresholds. We used the classic “hole in card” method to determine the dominant eye for 28 adult observers (11 males and 17 females). We then compared contrast thresholds between the dominant and non-dominant eyes using grating stimuli biased to be processed more strongly either by the magnocellular (MC) or parvocellular (PC) pathway. Using non-parametric mean rank tests, the dominant eye was more sensitive overall than the non-dominant eye to both stimuli (z = −2.54, p = 0.01). The dominant eye was also more sensitive to the PC-biased stimulus (z = −2.22, p = 0.03) but not the MC-biased stimulus (z = −1.16, p = 0.25). We discuss the clinical relevance of these results as well as the implications for parallel visual pathways. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In this study, a cohort of hereditary retinoblastoma patients at increased risk for TRB was identified and the usefulness of aggressive neuroimaging was examined. Design: Retrospective review of the medical records and MRI reports of patients with retinoblastoma treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2016. Participants: Three hundred forty-nine total patients with retinoblastoma, including 215 hereditary retinoblastoma patients in the screening group. Methods: We reviewed 804 MRI studies of the orbit or brain. Patient and disease characteristics, including laterality, family history, and gene mutation status were analyzed. The impression of every MRI was coded 1 to 5, each value representing a different abnormality. Main Outcome Measures: We calculated the incidence of TRB in patients with germline disease as well as the incidence of screening MRI scans showing TRB. Results: Among our hereditary retinoblastoma screening cohort (n=215) 4 patients with TRB were identified on screening MRI. All 4 patients showed bilateral disease, pineal gland tumors, and a latency period of at least 1 year. Three of the 4 were deceased by the end of the study. The incidence of TRB diagnosis was 1.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7%–4.9%). Of the 804 screening MRI scans performed on the screening cohort, 691 (86%) were unremarkable and 4 reported a lesion suspicious for TRB. The overall incidence of detecting TRB on screening MRI in the at-risk cohort was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%–1.3%) with a number needed to treat of 202. Conclusions: All cases of TRB in our center during the study period developed before the patient was 3 years of age and after a total of only 4 lifetime MRIs. Overall survival from TRB was not improved as a result of screening, and many false-positive results required additional, subsequent MRI scans with anesthesia. © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology
"Novozhilova S.; Reynaud A.; Hess R.F.";0.0;Short-term monocular deprivation induces an interocular delay;2021;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2021.05.003;Short term monocular deprivation modulates ocular dominance, such that the previously deprived eye's contribution to the binocular percept increases, supposedly as a result of changes in contrast-gain. Therefore, the processing time of the previously patched eye would be expected to speed up as a result of an increase in contrast gain. In order to test this hypothesis, this study examines the effects of short-term monocular deprivation on interocular synchronicity. The present study uses a paradigm based on the Pulfrich phenomenon. The stimulus used for testing consists of elements defining a cylinder rotating in depth, that allows measurement of any interocular delay. The interocular delay was measured at baseline before patching and at outcome, after one hour of monocular deprivation with an opaque or translucent patch. Contrary to expectations, short-term monocular deprivation induces an interocular delay, albeit not always significant, in the previously patched eye. The amplitude of this effect is larger with opaque patching compared to translucent patching. These results are the first report of a non-beneficial effect – i.e. a slowing down in the processing time of the previously patched-eye. They indicate that the plasticity effects of monocular deprivation are not exclusively mediated by contrast gain mechanisms and that light adaptation mechanisms might also be involved in the plasticity resulting from short-term monocular deprivation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

However, whether short-term monocular deprivation affects temporal processing per se is not clear. To address this issue, we conducted a study to investigate the effect of monocular deprivation on dichoptic temporal synchrony. We tested ten adults with normal vision and patched their dominant eye with an opaque patch for 2.5 h. A temporal synchrony paradigm was used to measure if temporal synchrony thresholds change as a result of monocular pattern deprivation. In this paradigm, we displayed two pairs of Gaussian blobs flickering at 1 Hz with either the same or different phased- temporal modulation. In Experiment 1, we obtained the thresholds for detecting temporal asynchrony under dichoptic viewing configurations. We compared the thresholds for temporal synchrony between before and after monocular deprivation and found no significant changes of the interocular synchrony. In Experiment 2, we measured the monocular thresholds for detecting temporal asynchrony. We also found no significant changes of the monocular synchrony of either the patched eye or the unpatched eye. Our findings suggest that short-term monocular deprivation induced-plasticity does not influence monocular or dichoptic temporal synchrony at low temporal frequency. © Copyright © 2020 Chen, Min, Cheng, Chen, Wang, Tao, Lu, Qu, Huang, Hess and Zhou.

The present study investigated whether these theta modulations existed in children and whether they were associated with attentional problems in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Electroencephalography signals were recorded from typically developing (TD) children and children with ADHD (TD: n = 24; ADHD: n = 22) while they performed a cued covert visual attention task. The participants responded to a target following a cue designed as human eyes that gazed to the left or right visual field (70% validity). Compared with the TD children, the children with ADHD showed increased midfrontal theta ERS and significant posterior theta lateralization in response to the cues. More importantly, we found that the stronger posterior theta lateralization in the right hemisphere exhibited a positive trial-based correlation with the larger midfrontal theta ERS and predicted lower RT variability at the trial level in the children with ADHD. We suggest that ADHD may be associated with some enhanced systems in the frontal and posterior areas via theta oscillations, which may be involved in the compensatory maturation for their attention deficits in childhood, thereby promoting the stability of behavioral responses. © 2020 The Authors"
"Brascamp J.W.; Cuthbert P.; Ling S.";0.0;Conflict defined by global gestalt can modulate binocular rivalry suppression;2020;Journal of Vision;10.1167/jov.20.13.3;"Binocular rivalry suppression is thought to necessarily require local interocular conflict: the presence of incompatible image elements, such as orthogonal contours, in retinally corresponding regions of two monocular displays. Whether suppression can also be driven by conflict at the level of spatially nonlocal surface or object representations is unclear. Here, we kept local contour conflict constant while varying global conflict, defined by the gestalt formed by the two monocular displays. Specifically, each eye was presented with a grid of image elements (crosses or plusses), placed such that the two eyes’ individual grid elements did not directly overlap but the grids as a whole did. In a “shared motion” condition, all elements moved in unison, inviting a gestalt made up of all elements across both eyes; in a “different motions” condition, the elements’ trajectories differed between eyes, inviting a gestalt of two overlapping surfaces, each associated with one eye. Perceptual disappearances of image elements occurred more readily in the different motions condition, an observation that could not be explained by any between-condition differences in local contour conflict. In a second experiment, we furthermore established that, whereas perceptual disappearances in the shared motion condition tended to involve a single element at a time, in the different motions condition, multiple elements belonging to the same gestalt often disappeared together. These findings indicate that, even though binocular rivalry may critically rely on inhibition due to locally incompatible image elements, this inhibition also depends on the global gestalt to which these elements contribute.

The cornerstone in the management of this disorder is based on increasing visual stimulation of the amblyopic eye by occlusion, by administering atropine or by causing optical penalization of the dominant eye. All these treatment options have shown some limits in terms of efficacy, due to the suboptimal treatment adherence for the patients and the lack of long-term clinical outcomes. Moreover, although it is well known that clinical efficacy decreases with age, new evidence is suggesting that cortical plasticity can be induced also in older children. For these reasons, new treatment options are being studied, in order to extend the “treatment window” beyond the critical period also in older patients. In this review, we will discuss all the most promising novel pharmacological agents in the management of amblyopia. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Studying the underlying neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry is useful for understanding the mechanisms of interocular inhibition. Levelt's Propositions, a set of four propositions that were originally published over fifty years ago, are not only useful for characterizing the perceptual dynamics of binocular rivalry, but can also provide a metric for assessing the common or differential neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry when diverse stimulus types are used. In the present study, we conducted a series of psychophysics experiments, where we compared the rivalry dynamics of two quite different types of stimuli. Orthogonal gratings, a classic type of rivalry stimulus, were contrasted with luminance patches, a type of rivalry stimulus that is relatively less studied. Our results showed that, similar to the orthogonal gratings, the alternate percepts in luminance-only rivalry were described by the modified Levelt's Propositions, despite the clearly slower alternation rates for luminance patches. However, unlike the mixed percepts observed during transitions between oriented gratings, fusion percepts during luminance rivalry were common, could be lustrous, and obeyed the same Propositions, suggesting a regime of tri-stability. Overall, both types of rivalry are consistent with recent models that posit separate binocular and monocular channels embedded within neural circuits that also accomplish contrast normalization. Finally, luminance rivalry is discussed in the contexts of binocular summation and suppression, as well as Fechner's paradox. © 2020 The Authors

It is questionable whether electroocu-lographic responses are similar in both eyes despite ocular dominance in human beings. We studied the effect of different electrooculographic stimulation parameters, in terms of directionality, linear and angular velocity, contrast, and state of adaptation to light/dark, that may induce possible interocular differences in visual function. The study was carried out with electroencephalography-type surface electrodes placed in the medial, lateral, superior, and inferior positions of both human eyes to record the eye movements. We found a greater amplitude of the EOG response in the left eye than to the right eye for light bars moving from right to left (p < 0.01; t-test). The EOG response amplitude was similar in both eyes for light bars moving in vertical directions, but greater than horizontal or rotational stimuli. We conclude that vertical stimuli should be used for EOG functional evaluation of eye movements, since horizontal stimuli generate significant interocular differences. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: Twenty-three volunteers, who played VR games in two modes (immersive and non-immersive) for 30 min, were enrolled. Visual parameters were examined before and after using VR. Accommodative factors were measured using static and dynamic methods. Subjective symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire. Differences according to VR content were compared, and correlations between each visual parameter were analyzed. Results: There were no changes in refraction or accommodative factors after use of the VR. However, there was a significant increase in the near point of accommodation (NPA), the near point of convergence (NPC), and subjective symptom scores after using the immersive mode. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between baseline values of near exophoria and mean accommodative lag of the dominant eye, and also revealed a negative correlation between NPA and mean accommodative lag in the non-dominant eye. Conclusions: The use of VR for 30 min increased NPA and NPC, especially after the immersive mode was used. In addition, higher exophoria and smaller NPA is associated with increased accommodative lag after using VR. © 2020 The Author(s).

Conclusions: The developmental dyslexia group presented a markedly worse performance in visual variables related to visual magnocellular function (i.e., frequency-doubling technology perimetry and ocular motor skills) compared with the importance of evaluating vision of individuals with assessments instruments to evaluate temporal processing, with contrast sensitivity threshold. © This content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attributions 4.0 International License."

This registered report examined the influence of non-affective cross-modal congruence on emotion perception. In Experiment 1, non-affective congruence was manipulated by matching or mismatching gender between visual and auditory modalities. Participants were instructed to attend to emotion information from only one modality while ignoring the other modality. Experiment 2 tested the inverse effectiveness rule by including both noise and noiseless conditions. Across two experiments, we found the effects of task-irrelevant emotional signals from one modality on emotional perception in the other modality, reflected in affective congruence, facilitation, and affective incongruence effects. The effects were stronger for the attend-auditory compared to the attend-visual condition, supporting a visual dominance effect. The effects were stronger for the noise compared to the noiseless condition, consistent with the inverse effectiveness rule. We did not find evidence for the effects of non-affective congruence on audiovisual integration of emotion across two experiments, suggesting that audiovisual integration of emotion may not require automatic integration of non-affective congruence information. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The purpose of this study was to present our investigation of the influence of reduced monocular luminance on monocular and dichoptic temporal synchrony processing in healthy adults. METHODS. Ten adults with normal or corrected to normal visual acuity participated in our psychophysical study. The temporal synchrony threshold in dichoptic (experiment 1), monocular (experiment 2), and binocular (experiment 3) viewing configurations was obtained from each observer. Four flickering Gaussian dots (one synchronous and one asynchronous pair of two dots) were displayed, from which the observers were asked to identify the asynchronous pair. The temporal phase lag in the signal pair (asynchronous) but not in the reference pair (synchronous) was varied. In addition, a neutral density (ND) filter of various intensities (1.3 and 2.0 log units) was placed before the dominant eye throughout the behavioral measurement. In the end, dichoptic, monocular, and binocular thresholds were measured for each observer. RESULTS. With decreasing monocular luminance, the dichoptic threshold (2 ND vs. 0 ND, P < 0.001; 2 ND vs. 1.3 ND P = 0.001) and monocular threshold (2 ND vs. 0 ND, P < 0.001; 2 ND vs. 1.3 ND, P = 0.003) increased; however, the bincoular threshold remained unaffected (P = 0.576). CONCLUSIONS. Reduced luminance induces delay and disturbs the discrimination of temporal synchrony. Our findings have clinical implications in visual disorders. © 2020 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.. All rights reserved."

There is a person-specific gaze bias caused by the kappa angle between the model's predicted and the actual gaze direction. Currently, people-specific models are usually established through calibration to increase accuracy. This paper proposes a novel estimation method of gaze direction based on the Differential Residual Network (D-ResNet),Which works by training the D-ResNet to predict gaze difference between two eye images (the same eye of the same subject) to eliminate gaze bias. At test time, only a few person - specific calibration samples are needed to infer the new eye image's gaze direction. Our model also incorporates the head pose vector to improve the robustness to free-head. Moreover, our left and right eye models are trained and tested separately which can select the dominant eye model based on the test error to predict gaze. Experiments on 2 public datasets validate our approach outperforms state-of-the-art person-independent and person- specific gaze estimation models. In particular, our model doesn't fail to calibrate even if there is only one calibration sample.  © 2021 IEEE.
"Valuch C.; Kulke L.";0.0;Predictive context biases binocular rivalry in children and adults with no positive relation to two measures of social cognition;2020;Scientific Reports;10.1038/s41598-020-58921-8;Integration of prior experience and contextual information can help to resolve perceptually ambiguous situations and might support the ability to understand other peoples’ thoughts and intentions, called Theory of Mind. We studied whether the readiness to incorporate contextual information for resolving binocular rivalry is positively associated with Theory-of-Mind-related social cognitive abilities. In children (12 to 13 years) and adults (18 to 25 years), a predictive temporal context reliably modulated the onset of binocular rivalry to a similar degree. In contrast, adult participants scored better on measures of Theory of Mind compared to children. We observed considerable interindividual differences regarding the influence of a predictive context on binocular rivalry, which were associated with differences in sensory eye dominance. The absence of a positive association between predictive effects on perception and Theory of Mind performance suggests that predictive effects on binocular rivalry and higher-level Theory-of-Mind-related abilities stem from different neurocognitive mechanisms. We conclude that the influence of predictive contextual information on basic visual processes is fully developed at an earlier age, whereas social cognitive skills continue to evolve from adolescence to adulthood. © 2020, The Author(s).

Methods: Ocular dominance was assessed via the "" hole in card"" method. The anatomical symmetry (including anterior chamber depth, lens thickness and axial length) in both eyes was analyzed via A scan ultrasound. The severely glaucomatous eye was determined by the mean defect of visual field. The association of ocular dominance with the severity of chronic PACG was then analyzed. This study followed the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to their entering the study cohort. Results: Visual acuity (LogMAR) was 0.39±0.24 in the dominant eye group, and 0.43±0.29 in the non-dominant eye group. Anterior chamber depth was (2.53±0.26)mm in the dominant eye group, and (2.54±0.29)mm in the non-dominant eye group. Lens thickness was (4.96±0.31)mm in the dominant eye group, and (4. 92±0.33)mm in the non-dominant eye group. Axial length was (22. 58±0.61)mm in the dominant eye group, and (22.73±1. 11)mm in the non-dominant eye group. No significant difference was found in visual acuity, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness or axial length between the dominant and non-dominant eye groups (t=-1.643, -0.797, 1.867, -1.345; all at P>0.05). The vertical cup-disc ratio of the dominant eye group was lower than that of the non-dominant eye group (0.55 [0.40, 0.80]vs. 0.80 [0.63, 0.90]). The mean defect in the visual field of the dominant eye group was lower than that in the non-dominant eye group (-6.54 [-16.70, -3.85]dB vs. -18.77 [-28.19, -8.55]dB), and the intraocular pressure in the dominant eye group was lower than that in the non-dominant eye group (21.00 [17.00, 27.75]mmHg vs. 24.50 [19.00, 36.25]mmHg) (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). Significant differences were found in mean defect, vertical cup-disc ratio and intraocular pressure between the two groups (Z=-3.781, -3.528, -2.126; all at P<0.05). The ratio of the severely glaucomatous eye being the non-dominant eye was 84.09%, which was much higher than that of the severely glaucomatous eye being the dominant eye (15.91%). The non-dominant eye was related to the severity of chronic PACG (χ2=40.909, P<0.001, Pearson contingency coefficient r=0.563).

"Cao R.; Pastukhov A.; Aleshin S.; Mattia M.; Braun J.";0.0;Binocular rivalry reveals an out-of-equilibrium neural dynamics suited for decision-making;2021;eLife;10.7554/ELIFE.61581;In ambiguous or conflicting sensory situations, perception is often ‘multistable’ in that it perpetually changes at irregular intervals, shifting abruptly between distinct alternatives. The interval statistics of these alternations exhibits quasi-universal characteristics, suggesting a general mechanism. Using binocular rivalry, we show that many aspects of this perceptual dynamics are reproduced by a hierarchical model operating out of equilibrium. The constitutive elements of this model idealize the metastability of cortical networks. Independent elements accumulate visual evidence at one level, while groups of coupled elements compete for dominance at another level. As soon as one group dominates perception, feedback inhibition suppresses supporting evidence. Previously unreported features in the serial dependencies of perceptual alternations compellingly corroborate this mechanism. Moreover, the proposed out-of-equilibrium dynamics satisfies normative constraints of continuous decision-making. Thus, multistable perception may reflect decision-making in a volatile world: integrating evidence over space and time, choosing categorically between hypotheses, while concurrently evaluating alternatives. © Cao et al.

Sustained percepts during interocular-switch rivalry (ISR), in which rivalrous left- and right-eye stimuli swap between eyes several times a second, often are attributed to competing binocularly driven neural representations of each rivalrous stimulus. An alternative view posits monocular neural competition together with a switch in eye dominance at the moment of each stimulus swap between eyes. Here, a range of experimental conditions was tested that would change the colors seen if mediated by eye dominance but not if by competition between binocularly driven responses. Observers viewed multiple chromatically rivalrous discs in various temporal and spatial patterns, and reported when all discs in view appeared the same color. Unlike typical ISR paradigms that swap the complete stimulus in each eye, some of the rivalrous discs were swapped at a different time, or faster frequency, than other discs. Monocular dominance of one eye at a time implies that all discs will rarely be seen as identical in color when some discs swap at a different frequency than others. On the other hand, competing binocularly driven neural responses are not affected by asynchronous swap timing among the individual discs. Results for every observer are in accord with competing responses at the level of binocularly driven, chromatically tuned neurons. Although an account based on eye dominance can be constructed using many small retinotopic zones that have independent timing for the moment of switching the dominant eye, competing binocularly driven responses are a more parsimonious explanation. © 2021.

However, few studies focus on both directions of this interaction, including the influence of incongruent visual stimulation on voice perception. In the present study, we implemented an interference paradigm involving 1152 videos of faces with either gender-congruent or gender-incongruent voices. Participants were asked to categorize the gender of either the face or the voice via key press. Task (face-based vs. voice-based gender categorization task) was manipulated both block-wise (relatively low executive control demands) and in a mixed block (relatively high executive control demands due to trial-by-trial task switches). We aimed at testing whether and how gender-incongruent stimuli negatively affected gender categorization speed and accuracy. The results indicate significant congruency effects in both directions – gender-incongruent visual information negatively affected voice categorization time and errors, and gender-incongruent voices affected visual face categorization. However, the former effect was stronger, supporting theories postulating visual dominance in face-voice integration. Congruency effects, which were not significantly reduced over the course of the experiment, were larger under high executive control demands (task switches), suggesting the availability of fewer attentional resources for incongruency resolution. Overall, voices generally appear to be processed in conjunction with facial information, which yields enhanced processing for more authentic voices, that is, voices that do not violate face-based expectancies. The data strengthen theories of face-voice processing emphasizing strong interaction between both processing channels. © 2018 The Voice Foundation
"Metzger B.A.; Beck D.M.";0.0;Probing the mechanisms of probe-mediated binocular rivalry;2020;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2020.04.011;"Binocular rivalry occurs when incompatible images are presented simultaneously but separately to each eye. Perceptual dominance reverses over time such that one image temporarily dominates perception, while the other image is suppressed. Prior research has shown that briefly-presented probes modulate perception such that probes presented to the suppressed eye tend to produce shorter percept durations relative to when probes are presented to the dominant eye. This pattern suggests that probes strengthen the competitive strength of the image over which they appear. However, it remains unclear whether probe-modulated effects on binocular rivalry are equivalent across the visual field, in particular as a function of whether probes appear within the region of interocular conflict (i.e on-object) or outside the region of interocular conflict (i.e. off-object). We tested this by manipulating whether probes appeared on-object or off-object. We replicate prior work showing that suppressed-eye probes produce shorter percept durations relative to dominant-eye probes. Critically, however, we show that percept duration also varies as a function of whether probes appear on vs. off the rivalry objects; that is, differences in percept duration between suppressed-eye and dominant-eye probes were much larger for on-object than off-object probes. Importantly, however, the difference between suppressed-eye and dominant-eye probes was still significant for off-object probes. Together these results suggest dynamic mechanisms at work in probe-mediated rivalry, such that on-object probe effects are larger relative to smaller, yet reliable off-object effects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Different from previous methods, we extract both disparity and fusion features from multiple levels to simulate hierarchical processing of the stereoscopic images in human brain. Given that the ocular dominance plays an important role in quality evaluation, the fusion weights assignment module (FWAM) is proposed to assign weight to guide the fusion of the left and the right features respectively. Experimental results on four public stereoscopic image databases show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art SIQA methods on both symmetrical and asymmetrical distortion stereoscopic images. © 2021 IEEE.
Teper S.J.;0.0;Update on the management of uveitic macular edema;2021;Journal of Clinical Medicine;10.3390/jcm10184133;"Uveitic macular edema (ME) is a frequent complication in 8.3% of uveitis patients and is a leading cause of serious visual impairment in about 40% of cases. Despite the numerous available drugs for its treatment, at least a third of patients fail to achieve satisfactory improvement in visual acuity. First-line drugs are steroids administered by various routes, but drug intolerance or ineffectiveness occur frequently, requiring the addition of other groups of therapeutic drugs. Immunomodulatory and biological drugs can have positive effects on inflammation and often on the accompanying ME, but most uveitic randomized clinical trials to date have not aimed to reduce ME; hence, there is no clear scientific evidence of their effectiveness in this regard. Before starting therapy to reduce general or local immunity, infectious causes of inflammation should be ruled out.

Depriving one eye of spatial information for 2–3 h increased subsequent sensory dominance of that eye. However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. The present study sought to address this issue and determine the consequences of short-term monocular deprivation on inter-ocular suppression of each eye. Sensory eye dominance was examined before and after depriving an eye of all input using an opaque patch for 2.5 h, in six adult participants with normal binocular vision. We used a percept tracking task during binocular rivalry (BR) to assess the relative eye dominance, and an objective probe detection task under continuous flash suppression (CFS) to quantify each eye's susceptibility to inter-ocular suppression. The monocular contrast increment threshold of each eye was also measured using the probe task to ascertain if the altered eye dominance is accompanied by changes in monocular perception. Our BR results replicated previous findings of a shift of relative dominance towards the eye that has been deprived of form information. More crucially, using CFS we demonstrated reduced inter-ocular suppression of the deprived eye with no complementary changes in the other eye, and no monocular changes in increment threshold. These findings imply that short-term monocular deprivation alters binocular interactions. The differential effect on inter-ocular suppression between eyes may have important implications for the use of patching as a therapy to recover visual function in amblyopia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Whether the macula affects ocular dominance or ocular dominance affects the macula is also a subject of interest. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of sighting ocular dominance with macular photostress test time and middle macular layer thickness. METHODS One-hundred eyes of 50 healthy adult volunteers were included in this cross-sectional study. Sighting eye dominance was decided by a hole-in-the-card test. The macular photostress test was performed by exposing the eye to the ophthalmoscope light for 10 seconds and measuring the time taken to return to visual acuity within one row of pre-light exposure acuity. The spectral-domain optical coherence tomography examinations were performed to measure thickness of middle macular layers (i.e., outer nuclear, outer plexiform, inner nuclear, and inner plexiform). Refractive error and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were also recorded. RESULTS The comparison of dominant and nondominant eyes in the aspect of refractive error, IOP, and macular photostress test time did not show statistically significant differences (P >.05). The thicknesses of macular outer nuclear, outer plexiform, inner nuclear, and inner plexiform layers were similar in the dominant and nondominant eyes (P >.05). In addition, macular photostress time was not statistically significantly correlated with the thickness of middle macular layers (P >.05). CONCLUSIONS The thickness of middle macular layers and macular photostress recovery time are similar in dominant and nondominant eyes. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Shotgun champions require unique performance in binocularity and rapid color discrimination. Patients and Methods: Twenty-nine champion clay-target shooters, 14 normal Army and 12 color-normal subjects were tested with conventional near vision tests and on PDI-Check, a series of dynamic, near vision tests on the autostereoscopic Nintendo console. Results: Conventional tested shotgunners had all perfect Ishihara and 75% best 40 sec Stereo fly while Army had 92%perfect Ishihara and 69% best stereo fly. On PDI-Check, experienced shotgunners with median stereo of 17 (IQR 12–41) arc sec were better than Army volunteers 59 (IQR 30 to 487) arc seconds (Mann–Whitney U=62, p=0.04). Median PDI-Check for shotgun compared to Army was 88% compared to 84% for blue cone, 90% compared to 84% for green and 77% compared to 72% (red, Mann– Whitney p=0.05). Adding dark cherry filter shooting glasses improved the red and green color detection (p<0.01). This study lacked power to detect eye dominance using PDI Check color or stereo. Conclusion: Many champion shotgun shooters had outstanding dynamic near stereo and better-than-average color vision which could be optimized with dark filter spectacles for red and green hues.

Foveated rendering is emerging as an indispensable technique for reconciling interactive frame rates with ever-higher head-mounted display resolutions. Here, we present a simple yet effective technique for further reducing the cost of foveated rendering by leveraging ocular dominance - the tendency of the human visual system to prefer scene perception from one eye over the other. Our new approach, eye-dominance-guided foveated rendering (EFR), renders the scene at a lower foveation level (with higher detail) for the dominant eye than the non-dominant eye. Compared with traditional foveated rendering, EFR can be expected to provide superior rendering performance while preserving the same level of perceived visual quality. © 2020 IEEE.
"Uy H.S.; Artiaga J.C.M.";0.0;Comparison of two different intravitreal injection techniques;2021;Clinical Ophthalmology;10.2147/OPTH.S309501;Objective: To compare the effectiveness, procedure time and safety outcomes of two different intravitreal injections (IVI) techniques. Methods: This was a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial of 200 adult eyes receiving intravitreal medications for various indications. Eyes were assigned (1:1) to undergo IVI using either an intravitreal injection guide (IIG) (n= 100) or conventional dual blade speculum plus surgical caliper (DBS) (n=100). All IVI were administered using a 30-gauge needle placed 4 mm posterior to the inferior limbus. The main outcome measures were rate of successful IVI administration, procedure time (seconds) as measured by a stopwatch from application to removal of IIG or DBS, patient preference for IVI technique and adverse events. Results: The two groups were similar in terms of mean age (P=0.398), laterality (P=0.671), indication for treatment (P=0.175) and medication type (P=0.489). All IVI procedures were successfully completed in both groups. The mean procedure time was shorter using the IIG (9.94 ± 2.87 seconds) versus DBS (21.85 ± 7.25 seconds) technique (P ≤ 0.01). The incidence of post-injection subconjunctival hemorrhage was higher when the DBS was applied (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.22–4.53). Patients with previous history of IVI preferred the IIG over the DBS. No other injection-related adverse events were observed in both groups. Conclusion: DBS and IIG techniques are similarly effective and safe for the administration of intravitreal medications. The IIG appears to significantly reduce procedure time, be associated with a lower incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage and engender better patient acceptance.

Subjects and methods: This was a prospective, randomized, double-masked, and multicentre clinical trial. Subjects with a diagnosis of presbyopia (n = 75) were randomized 2:1 to UNR844 or placebo. On days 1–7, all subjects were dosed unilaterally (twice a day, b.i.d.) in their non-dominant eye to ensure safety and tolerability prior to days 8–91 when dosing was changed to bilateral (b.i.d.). Clinical assessments, including DCNVA and adverse events (AEs), were recorded at each study visit. Patients who completed the study were recruited into a non-interventional follow-up study that monitored them until 7 months after their final UNR844 exposure. The primary endpoints were safety and the mean change in DCNVA from baseline in the study eye. Results: UNR844 administration (n = 50) produced no safety concerns and was well-tolerated, with no clinically-relevant changes in best-corrected distance visual acuity, pupil size, intraocular pressure, or discontinuations due to adverse events. DCNVA improved in the study eye in the UNR844 group compared to placebo during the 91 days of treatment [UNR844 vs. placebo, mean change in LogMAR (SD); −0.159 (0.120) vs. −0.079 (0.116)]. Bilateral DCNVA improved, with 53.1% UNR844 vs. 21.7% placebo subjects gaining ≥10 letters. Improvements in DCNVA were sustained at 5 and 7 months after UNR844 dosing ceased. Conclusions: These results support further development of UNR844 ophthalmic solution for the treatment of presbyopia. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply."

We introduce Gaze+Hold as an eyes-only technique that builds on this ability to leverage the eyes as separate input channels, with one eye modulating the state of interaction while the other provides continuous input. Gaze+Hold enables direct manipulation beyond pointing which we explore through the design of Gaze+Hold techniques for a range of user interface tasks. In a user study, we evaluated performance, usability and user's spontaneous choice of eye for modulation of input. The results show that users are effective with Gaze+Hold. The choice of dominant versus non-dominant eye had no effect on performance, perceived usability and workload. This is significant for the utility of Gaze+Hold as it affords flexibility for mapping of either eye in different configurations.  © 2021 ACM.

Methods: Consenting adults visiting the ophthalmology and optometry clinics for a routine eye examination without any ocular comorbidity were enrolled. Participants underwent optical coherence tomography for macular thickness, retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and ganglion cell layer thickness. The macular pigment optical density levels were determined in the dominant eye using the QuantifEye device by trained observers. Results: In total, 336 eyes of 336 participants with a mean age of 39.2 ± 14.4 years were included of which 103 (30%) were Caucasians, 111 (33%) were African Americans, 29 (9%) were South Asian Indians and 94 (28%) were Hispanics. The mean macular pigment optical density value across the entire study population was 0.47 ± 0.15. South Asian Indians (0.58 ± 0.16) and Hispanics (0.52 ± 0.15) had significantly higher mean macular pigment optical density values compared with Caucasians (0.41 ± 0.16) and African Americans (0.38 ± 0.15). Linear regression analysis showed that there was a significant association between ethnicities and macular pigment optical density values when adjusted for age (β coefficient = 0.31, 95% confidence interval = 0.029–0.58, p < 0.001 for South Asian Indian and Hispanic ethnic groups compared with African Americans). There were no differences in the retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell layer thickness across ethnic groups. Linear regression analysis also did not reveal any significant association between macular pigment optical density levels and retinal nerve fibre layer or ganglion cell layer thickness. Conclusion: Caucasians and African Americans have lower macular pigment optical density compared with South Asian Indians and Hispanics. There is no clinically significant association between macular pigment optical density levels and retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell layer thickness in healthy individuals across races. © The Author(s) 2020.

Forty-four subjects were randomly but equally assigned to the active or placebo group. Two active or placebo capsules were taken once daily for 6 weeks. Accommodative function, tear film break-up time, visual acuity, the value of Schirmer’s test, macular pigment optical density level, muscle hardness, and a questionnaire were evaluated before and after a 6-week intervention. Each group included 20 subjects in the efficacy analysis. The active group showed a significant improvement in the percentage of pupillary response of an average of both eyes and dominant eye pre- and post-visual display terminal operation at 6 weeks compared with the placebo group. Moreover, the active group showed a significant improvement in the scores of “A sensation of trouble in focusing the eyes” and “Difficulty in seeing objects in one’s hand and nearby, or fine print” compared with the placebo group between before and after ingestion. Therefore, 6-weeks consumption of the test food inhibited a decrease in the accommodative function caused by visual display terminal operation (UMIN000036989). © 2021 JCBN.

There is considerable debate as to whether similar regularities govern the first percept after stimulus onset and percepts during prolonged presentation. We address this question in a visual pattern-component rivalry paradigm by presenting two overlaid drifting gratings, which participants perceived as individual gratings passing in front of each other (“segregated”) or as a plaid (“integrated”). We varied the enclosed angle (“opening angle”) between the gratings (experiments 1 and 2) and stimulus orientation (experiment 2). The relative number of integrated percepts increased monotonically with opening angle. The point of equality, where half of the percepts were integrated, was at a smaller opening angle at onset than during prolonged viewing. The functional dependence of the relative number of integrated percepts on opening angle showed a steeper curve at onset than during prolonged viewing. Dominance durations of integrated percepts were longer at onset than during prolonged viewing and increased with opening angle. The general pattern persisted when stimuli were rotated (experiment 2), despite some perceptual preference for cardinal motion directions over oblique directions. Analysis of eye movements, specifically the slow phase of the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), confirmed the veridicality of participants’ reports and provided a temporal characterization of percept formation after stimulus onset. Together, our results show that the first percept after stimulus onset exhibits a different dependence on stimulus parameters than percepts during prolonged viewing. This underlines the distinct role of the first percept in multistability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

However, while such approaches may well be more portable, realistic, or satisfying than traditional photographic presentations, it is less clear that they have any superiority in terms of student learning. In this study, it was hypothesized that virtual and mixed reality presentations of pelvic anatomy will have an advantage over two-dimensional (2D) presentations and perform approximately equal to physical models and that this advantage over 2D presentations will be reduced when stereopsis is decreased by covering the non-dominant eye. Groups of 20 undergraduate students learned pelvic anatomy under seven conditions: physical model with and without stereo vision, mixed reality with and without stereo vision, virtual reality with and without stereo vision, and key views on a computer monitor. All were tested with a cadaveric pelvis and a 15-item, short-answer recognition test. Compared to the key views, the physical model had a 70% increase in accuracy in structure identification; the virtual reality a 25% increase, and the mixed reality a non-significant 2.5% change. Blocking stereopsis reduced performance on the physical model by 15%, on virtual reality by 60%, but by only 2.5% on the mixed reality technology. The data show that virtual and mixed reality technologies tested are inferior to physical models and that true stereopsis is critical in learning anatomy. © 2019 American Association of Anatomists"
"Tagu J.; Doré-Mazars K.; Vergilino-Perez D.";0.0;Saccade accuracy as an indicator of the competition between functional asymmetries in vision;2020;Experimental Brain Research;10.1007/s00221-019-05717-6;Hemispheric specialization refers to the fact that cerebral hemispheres are not equivalent and that cognitive processes are lateralized in the brain. Although the potential links between handedness and the left hemisphere specialization for language have been widely studied, little attention has been paid to other motor preferences, such as eye dominance, that also are lateralized in the brain. For example, saccadic accuracy is higher in the hemifield contralateral to the dominant eye compared to the ipsilateral hemifield. Saccade accuracy is, however, also known to be sensitive to other functional asymmetries, such as the lateralization of visuo-spatial attention in the right hemisphere of the brain. Using a global effect paradigm in three different saccade latency ranges, we here propose to use saccade accuracy as an indicator of visual functional asymmetries. We show that for the shortest latencies, saccade accuracy is higher in the left than in the right visual hemifield, which could be due to the lateralization of visuo-spatial attention in the right hemisphere. For the longest latencies, however, saccade accuracy is higher toward the right than the left hemifield, probably due to the lateralization of local and global processing in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. These results could have a major impact on studies designed to measure the degree of lateralization of individuals. We here discuss both the theoretical and clinical contributions of these results. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

We tested if unilateral autoimmune optic neuritis (aON) manifests more frequently on the left than the right eye in clinical and neuroimaging terms and whether Google searches for aON symptoms reflect this bias, too. We employed a retrospective analysis of a patient cohort from 2009 to 2019 with 552 unilateral aONs and 374 corresponding MRI imaging data sets. Searchmetrics Suite keywords tool was applied for the analysis of Google searches on aON-symptoms in Germany, the US and the UK for the last 12 months. Left eye aON manifestations were more frequent than right aON manifestations (55.3% vs. 44.7%, p = 0.015) and 1.9 times more likely to be associated with a pathological MRI finding in the affected optic nerve (p = 0.013). Keywords describing aON-typical but not other ocular symptoms were more frequently associated with Google searches for the left in comparison to the right eye (p < 0.001). Autoimmune optic neuritis more frequently affects the left than the right eye and people search on the Internet more often for left-sided aON symptoms. Although a reporting bias due to an increased perception of left eye symptoms is one possible explanation, MRI evidence of more frequent optic nerve affection for the left in comparison to the right side suggests a leftward lateralization bias similar to the one previously shown for cerebral neuroinflammatory lesions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Keratoconus results in image quality loss in one or both eyes due to increased corneal distortion. This study quantified the depth of monocular suppression in keratoconus due to this image quality loss using a binocular contrast rivalry paradigm. METHODS. Contrast rivalry was induced in 50 keratoconic cases (11–31 years) and 12 age-matched controls by dichoptically viewing orthogonal Gabor patches of 5 cycles per degree (cpd) and 1.5 cpd spatial frequency for 120 seconds with their best-corrected spectacles and rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses. The dwell time on each eye’s percept was determined at baseline (100% contrast bilaterally) and at varying contrast levels (80–2.5%) in the stronger eye of keratoconus or dominant eye of controls. The contrast reduction needed in the stronger eye to balance dwell times on both eyes was considered a measure of suppression depth. RESULTS. At baseline with 5 cpd stimuli and spectacle correction, the rivalry switches were less frequent and biased toward the stronger eye of cases, all relative to controls (P < 0.001). The contrast balance point of cases (20.51% [10.7–61%]) was lower than the controls (99.80% [98.6–100%]; P < 0.001) and strongly associated with the overall and interocular difference in disease severity (r = 0.83, P < 0.001). The suppression depth reduced for 1.5 cpd (70.8% [21.7–94%]), relative to 5 cpd stimulus (P < 0.001) and with contact lenses (80.1% [49.5–91.7%]), relative to spectacles (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The eye with lesser disease severity dominates binocular viewing in keratoconus. The suppression depth of the poorer eye depends on the extent of bilateral disease severity, optical correction modality, and the target spatial frequency. © 2021 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc..

Methods: Ten adult anisometropic patients underwent six brief (2 h) training sessions over a period of 4 weeks. Each training session consisted in the occlusion of the amblyopic eye combined with physical exercise (intermittent cycling on a stationary bike). Visual acuity (measured with ETDRS charts), stereoacuity (measured with the TNO test), and sensory eye dominance (measured with binocular rivalry) were tested before and after each training session, as well as in follow-up visits performed 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after the end of the training. Results: After six brief (2 h) training sessions, visual acuity improved in all 10 patients (0.15 ± 0.02 LogMar), and six of them also recovered stereopsis. The improvement was preserved for up to 1 year after training. A pilot experiment suggested that physical activity might play an important role for the recovery of visual acuity and stereopsis. Conclusions: Our results suggest a noninvasive training strategy for adult human amblyopia based on an inverse-occlusion procedure combined with physical exercise. © 2018 The Authors.

Functional lateral preferences, postural lateral preferences and the preferred chewing side were assessed in 376 young individuals (178 men, 198 women, mean age: 20.07). Of the 376 individuals, 31.1 % were strong right-handers, 58.8 % were weak right-handers, 2.9% were ambidextrous, 5.9% were weak left-handers, 1.3% was strong left-handers. There was a right-side preference for handedness (89.9%), footedness (75.8%), earedness (59.2%), eyedness (paper tube test, 70.0%), eyedness (Rosenbach dominant eye test, 62.9%), hand clapping (78.4%), leg-crossing (64.4%), preferred chewing side (60.9%) and a left-side preference for hand-clasping (55.2%), and arm-folding (55.3%). Only eyedness (paper tube test) differed between the genders; women mostly preferred the left eye when looking through the paper tube. Handedness, footedness, earedness, and eyedness (paper tube) were each related with hand-clapping, however not with hand clasping and arm folding. In addition, hand clapping and leg crossing (but not hand clasping and arm folding) were each related to preferred chewing side. In general, individuals who preferred the right side were right sided in all of the variables, while individuals who preferred the left side were closely related to individuals who preferred both sides. Thus, it can be concluded that individuals who preferred the left side tended to be mostly bilateral, compared with individuals who preferred only the right side. These results may bring insight into the relationships between functional and postural lateral preferences and the preferred chewing side for the young population. © 2019, Yuzuncu Yil Universitesi Tip Fakultesi.

A recent study (Lunghi & Sale, 2015) investigated whether exercise also affects visual plasticity in adult humans. The plastic effect they measured was the shift in ocular dominance caused by 2 hr of monocular deprivation (e.g., by an eye patch). They used a binocular rivalry task to measure this shift. They found that the magnitude of the shift was increased by exercise during the deprivation period. This effect of exercise was later disputed by a study that used a different behavioral task (Zhou, Reynaud, & Hess, 2017). Our goal was to determine whether the difference in task was responsible for that study's failure to find an exercise effect. We set out to replicate Lunghi and Sale (2015). We measured ocular dominance with a rivalry task before and after 2 hr of deprivation.We measured data from two conditions in 30 subjects. On two separate days, they either performed exercise or rested during the deprivation period. Contrary to the previous study, we find no significant effect of exercise. We hypothesize that exercise may affect rivalry dynamics in a way that interacts with the measurement of the deprivation effect. © 2019 The Authors.
"Cooper P.R.; Mendola J.D.";0.0;Abnormal sensory eye dominance in stereoanomalous subjects;2019;Journal of Vision;10.1167/19.13.14;Stereoanomalous (SA) subjects have normal visual acuity but reduced stereopsis and may have a prevalence of up to 30%. It has been suggested that, in SA subjects, an imbalance in interocular inhibition might underlie an asymmetry in sensory eye dominance (SED). Our study expands upon previous findings by examining binocular rivalry (BR) mean dominance durations, dichoptic masking (DM) thresholds and SED for a group of SA subjects compared to nãive controls. We examined BR dominance durations and DM thresholds for 15 stereonormal (SN) subjects and 10 SA subjects with normal or corrected-tonormal visual acuity. All subjects had visual acuity of 20/40 or better and less than or equal to two lines difference between eyes. Individuals who scored ≥6/9 on the Randot stereo test and <100 arcmin on the PacMan Stereo Acuity test were considered SN. We compared near-vertical and near-horizontal oriented sine-wave gratings for BR and DM in order to dissociate stereo-related mechanisms that rely on horizontal disparities from other eye-based integration mechanisms. Mean randot scores for SN subjects were 8.5/ 9 with a PacMan stereoacuity of 33 arcmin, and SA subjects scored 2.5/9 and 3,380 arcmin, respectively. The mean difference in SED was 0.19 for SN and 0.48 for SA when measured with a neutral density filter bar. The SA group showed a large interocular difference in BR durations that was significantly greater than normal (p = 0.004) and correlated with loss of stereoacuity. Moreover, the interocular difference for DM was similarly greater for SA subjects (p = 0.04) although a proportional difference in monocular sensitivity could partially account for this. We also found that both SN and SA subjects presented higher DM thresholds and, to some extent, sensitivity for vertical than horizontal orientations. SA subjects show an abnormal bias toward their dominant eye for both BR and DM. These data suggest that common mechanisms of monocular sensitivity and interocular inhibition may limit multiple binocular measures and provides a practical link to better understand the heterogeneity of stereopsis in amblyopia. © 2019 The Authors.
"Akagi R.; Tonotsuka M.; Horie R.; Hirata K.; Ando S.";0.0;Effect of acute eye fatigue on cognition for young females: A pilot study;2019;PeerJ;10.7717/peerj.7978;The number of people suffering from eye fatigue induced by visual display terminal (VDT) viewing is expected to increase in the modern world. Eye dysfunction is suggested to induce a decrease in cognitive function, at least in the long term. Furthermore, considering other previous findings, it may be reasonable to think that acute or relatively short-term eye dysfunction attenuates cognitive function for not only older but also young individuals. Hence, clarification of the effect of eye fatigue induced by VDT viewing on cognitive performance is essential in order to maintain and/or improve our quality of life in the modern world regardless of age. The present study investigated the effect of eye fatigue induced by 1-h VDT viewing on cognitive performance, to test the hypothesis that such eye fatigue impairs cognitive performance in young individuals. A total of 19 healthy female university students voluntarily participated in this study. Before and after the 1-h VDT viewing or resting, the degree of eye fatigue and cognitive performance were evaluated. Refractive error measurement was performed to assess the degree of eye fatigue using a binocular auto refractometer, and a memory recognition task and Go/NoGo task were used to estimate cognitive performance. Response accuracy and reaction time were evaluated in the two tasks. Due to difficulty in interpreting the data of refractive error for one participant from the perspective of eye fatigue, the data for 18 participants were used for further analysis. The refractive error was significantly lower after than before the VDT viewing, but a corresponding change was not found before and after resting. Regarding cognitive performance, only the reaction time in the memory recognition task varied with the VDT viewing or resting. The reaction time was significantly longer after than before resting, without a corresponding difference before and after the VDT viewing. Thus, the 1-h VDT viewing induced eye fatigue, but relatively improved rather than attenuated reaction time in the memory recognition task. These results suggest that the effect of the increase in arousal level induced by the present VDT viewing on memory recognition compensated for the negative effect of 1-h resting of the eyes. We conclude that the acute eye fatigue induced by the 1-h VDT viewing does not have detrimental effects on cognition in young females at least under the present conditions. © Copyright 2019 Akagi et al.

To develop a novel dichoptic optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) paradigm and investigate its effectiveness in objectively quantifying the interocular suppression in subjects with monocular amblyopia. METHODS. Centripetal moving gratings with different contrast ratios and constant velocity were dichoptically presented to eight monocular anisometropic amblyopes and eight normal subjects. We analyzed the OKN records with an eye tracker (EyeLink; SR-Research, Ontario, Canada) to obtain the relationship between ocular-dominance of OKN and the interocular contrast ratio by fitting power curves, and examined the correlation between the effective contrast ratio for a balanced OKN and the visual acuity of the amblyopic eye in amblyopes. RESULTS. In normal subjects, the OKN pursuit times were roughly balanced for opposite directions when stimulated with centripetal gratings of same contrast; however, in amblyopes, the OKN pursuit times of the dominant eye exceeded that of the amblyopic eye. Increasing the contrast of one eye’s grating led to an increase in its OKN dominance. The OKN directional ratio (y) could be well fitted by a power function of the interocular contrast ratio (x): y = axb. Moreover, in amblyopes, the effective contrast ratio (xb ) for a balanced OKN correlated significantly positively with the visual acuity of the amblyopic eye (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, 0.9698). CONCLUSIONS. The OKN induced by dichoptic gratings moving centripetally could be used as a reliable measure to objectively quantify the interocular suppression. This paradigm, avoiding the need for subjective report from patients, offers a promising alternative index for research on the mechanisms of amblyopia and in clinical practice. © 2018 The Authors."

Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 38 unilateral amblyopic children (3–10 years old) were studied. All unilateral amblyopic children who had best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 0.30 logMAR or a difference of two Snellen lines of BCVA between their two eyes were included, and children who did not complete at least 75% of amblyopia treatment were excluded from this study. Eventually, a total of 19 and 21 subjects were included in case and control groups, respectively. Cases played I-BiT™ games, while controls had standard patch therapy and played with placebo I-BiT™ games, both for one month. All subjects were examined at baseline and after one-month therapy. Results: BCVA improved significantly in both groups after one-month treatment (case: P = 0.003, control: P < 0.001), while in comparison with each other, there was not any difference between them (P = 0.52). Although stereopsis improved in the case (P < 0.001) and control (P < 0.001), there was no significant difference between them pre and post-therapy. Our children played games for about 6 h total during one month in both groups, and their compliance was 87.5% and 76% in cases and controls, respectively. Two children were excluded due to their lower compliance of playing I-BiT™ games (n = 38). Conclusions: I-BiT™ game and patching with placebo game had similar BCVA improvement in amblyopic children after one-month treatment. It is suggested to conduct further randomized clinical trials with a larger sample size and longer duration of study and assessment of its recurrence. © 2019 Iranian Society of Ophthalmology

The present study examined the ERP correlates of MSI in healthy adults using short (500 ms) ecologically valid professional actor-produced emotions of fear or disgust as vocal exclamation or facial expression (unimodal conditions) or both (bimodal condition). Behaviourally, our results show a general visual dominance effect (similarly fast responses following bimodal and visual stimuli) and an MSI-related speedup of responses only for fear. Electrophysiologically, both P100 and N170 showed MSI-related amplitude increases only following fear, but not disgust stimuli. Our results show for the first time that the known differential neural processing of fear and disgust also holds for the integration of dynamic auditory and visual information. © 2019

The results showed the expected main effects of line position and hand used to bisect, as well as some interactions between factors. Specifically, the effect of the hand used to bisect on the deviation bias was different as a function of handedness and line position. In right-handers, there was a strong difference between the biases elicited by each hand, producing a hand-used asymmetry, observed for each spatial position of the line. In left-handers, there was no difference in deviation as a function of hand used to perform the bisection, except when all factors triggered attention toward the left side such as bisecting left-displaced lines, with the left dominant hand, producing a strong leftward deviation as compared to the reduced bias exhibited with the right non-dominant hand. Finally, the eye sighting dominance interacted with handedness and line position. Left-handers with a right sighting dominance showed a leftward bias when they bisected left-displaced lines, while right-handers with a left sighting dominance showed an inversed bias when they bisected rightward lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that the behavioral deviation bias relies on the integration of the hemispheric weights of the visuospatial processing of the stimuli, and the motoric component of the hand used to bisect, as well as those linked to individual laterality factors. When all these factors producing asymmetric cerebral activation coincide in the same direction, then their joint effect will provide the strongest asymmetric behavioral biases. © 2018 Ochando and Zago."

Research question: The purpose of this study was to investigate in a therapeutic context active and passive participant involvement during interpersonal support in balancing tasks of increasing sensorimotor difficulty. Methods: Ten older adults stood in semi-tandem stance and received support from a physical therapist (PT) in two support conditions: 1) physical support provided by the PT to the participant's back via an instrumented handle affixed to a harness worn by the participant (“passive” interpersonal touch; IPT) or 2) support by PT and participant jointly holding a handle instrumented with a force-torque transducer while facing each other (“active” IPT). The postural stability of both support conditions was measured using the root-mean-square (RMS) of the Centre-of-Pressure velocity (RMS dCOP) in the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions. Interpersonal postural coordination (IPC) was characterized in terms of cross-correlations between both individuals’ sway fluctuations as well as the measured interaction forces. Results: Active involvement of the participant decreased the participant's postural variability to a greater extent, especially under challenging stance conditions, than receiving support passively. In the passive support condition, however, stronger in-phase IPC between both partners was observed in the antero-posterior direction, possibly caused by a more critical (visual or tactile) observation of participants’ body sway dynamics by the therapist. In-phase cross-correlation time lags indicated that the therapist tended to respond to participants’ body sway fluctuations in a reactive follower mode, which could indicate visual dominance affecting the therapist during the provision of haptic support. Significance: Our paradigm implies that in balance rehabilitation more partnership-based methods promote greater postural steadiness. The implications of this finding with regard to motor learning and rehabilitation need to be investigated. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
"Li Z.; Gu R.; Qi M.; Cen J.; Zhang S.; Gu J.; Zeng X.; Chen Q.";0.0;Loss of vision dominance at the preresponse level in tinnitus patients: Preliminary behavioral evidence;2019;Frontiers in Neuroscience;10.3389/fnins.2019.00482;At present, the mechanisms underlying changes in visual processing in individuals with tinnitus remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether the vision dominance of individuals with tinnitus disappears at the preresponse level through behavioral study. A total of 38 individuals with tinnitus and 31 healthy controls completed a task in which they were asked to attend to either visual or auditory stimuli while ignoring simultaneous stimulus inputs from the other modality. We manipulated three levels of congruency between the simultaneous visual and auditory inputs: congruent (C), incongruent at the preresponse level (PRIC), and incongruent at the response level (RIC). Thus, we differentiated the cross-modal conflict explicitly into the preresponse (PRIC > C) and response (RIC > PRIC) levels. The results revealed no significant difference in the size of the preresponse level conflict between the auditory attention and visual attention conditions in tinnitus group. In brief, the preresponse level of individuals with tinnitus showed a loss in vision dominance. This may be due to the reduced interference of visual information in auditory processing.

Behavioral and neural correlates of attention can be observed when attention is both covertly and overtly oriented (with or without accompanying eye movements). Previous studies have demonstrated that at the grand-average level, lateralization of Event Related Potentials (ERP) is associated with attentional facilitation at cued, relative to un-cued locations. Yet, the correspondence between ERP lateralization and behavior has not been established at the single-subject level. Specifically, it is an open question whether inter-individual differences in the neural manifestation of attentional orienting can predict differences in perception. Here, we addressed this question by examining the correlation between ERP lateralization and visual sensitivity at attended locations. Participants were presented with a cue indicating where a low-contrast grating patch target will appear, following a delay of varying durations. During this delay, while participants were waiting for the target to appear, a task-irrelevant checkerboard probe was presented briefly and bilaterally. ERP was measured relative to the onset of this probe. In separate blocks, participants were requested to report detection of a low-contrast target either by making a fast eye-movement toward the target (overt orienting), or by pressing a button (covert orienting). Results show that in the covert orienting condition, ERP lateralization of individual participants was positively correlated with their mean visual sensitivity for the target. But, no such correlation was found in the overt orienting condition. We conclude that ERP lateralization of individual participants can predict their performance on a covert, but not an overt, target detection task. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

This visual dominance effect is proposed to arise from asymmetric facilitation and inhibition between modalities. It has also been proposed that, unlike adults, children appear predisposed to auditory information. We provide the first quantitative synthesis of studies exploring the Colavita effect, combining data from 70 experiments across 14 studies. A mixed-meta-regression model was applied to assess whether the Colavita effect is influenced by methodological factors and age group tested. Studies reporting response time data were used to test for the presence of asymmetrical facilitation between modalities. Studies with adult participants yielded a medium, approaching large, effect size. Studies exploring the Colavita effect in children yielded no Colavita effect. Across adult and child studies, no methodological factors influenced the effect. Contrary to asymmetrical facilitation, response time data suggested a general slowing under bimodal conditions. These findings suggest that whilst vision dominates in adults, this effect is absent in childhood. © 2018 The Authors

We investigated the pathology of overt attention in right hemisphere (RH) stroke patients differing in their severity of neglect symptoms by using eye-tracking during a dynamic attention task. Methods: Eye movements were recorded in 26 RH stroke patients (13 with and 13 without unilateral spatial neglect, and a matched group of 26 healthy controls during a Multiple Object Tracking task. We assessed the frequency and spatial distributions of fixations, as well as frequencies of eye movements to the left and to the right side of visual space so as to investigate individuals’ efficiency of visual processing, distribution of attentional processing resources, and oculomotoric orienting mechanisms. Results: Both patient groups showed increased fixation frequencies compared to controls. A spatial bias was found in neglect patients’ fixation distribution, depending on neglect severity (indexed by scores on the Behavioral Inattention Test). Patients with more severe neglect had more fixations within the right field, while patients with less severe neglect had more fixations within their left field. Eye movement frequencies were dependent on direction in the neglect patient group, as they made more eye movements toward the right than toward the left. Conclusion: The patient groups’ higher fixation rates suggest that patients are generally less efficient in visual processing. The spatial bias in fixation distribution, dependent on neglect severity, suggested that patients with less severe neglect were able to use compensational mechanisms in their contralesional space. The observed relation between eye movement rates and directions observed in neglect patients provides a measure of the degree of difficulty these patients may encounter during dynamic situations in daily life and supports the idea that directional oculomotor hypokinesia may be a relevant component in this syndrome. © 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we aimed to provide a normative dataset for sensory eye dominance using this task. Based on that, we also assessed the relationship between perceptual eye dominance and stereopsis. One-hundred and forty-two adults (average age: 24.00 ± 1.74 years old) with normal or corrected to normal monocular visual acuity (logMAR < 0.00) participated. Observer’s sensory eye dominance was quantified in two complementary ways: the interocular contrast ratio when the two eyes were balanced (i.e., the balance point) and the absolute value of the binocular perceived phase when each eye viewed maximum contrast stimuli in binocular phase combination task. Stereo acuities were measured with maximum contrast stimuli using an identical spatial frequency (0.30 cycles/degree) and stimulus arrangement to that used in the eye dominance assessment. The averaged balance point was 0.93 ± 0.06 (Mean ± SD), the averaged absolute value of the binocular perceived phase when both eyes viewed maximum contrast stimuli was 7.62 ± 5.91°, and the averaged stereo acuity was 2.19 ± 0.34 log arc seconds. Neither of these two sensory eye dominance measures were significantly correlated with stereo acuity (Balance point: ρ = 0.14, P = 0.10; Phase: ρ = −0.13, P = 0.13). The sensory eye dominance, as reflected using a phase combination task, and stereopsis are not significantly correlated in the normal-sighted population at low spatial frequencies. © 2018 Wang, Cui, He, Lin, Qu, Lu, Zhou and Hess."

Purpose: Evaluate light distortion (LD) in two modalities of contact lens (CL) wear: multifocal (MF) and monofocal (MV). Methods: This was a randomized, double-masked, crossover study involving 20 presbyopic patients. Patients were randomized first into either MF or MV for 15 days of use with a 1 week wash-out period between each lens type. The LD was evaluated with the Light Distortion Analyzer (LDA, University of Minho) under monocular and binocular conditions. The light distortion index (LDI, %), among other parameters were analyzed. Subjective quality of vision was assessed with the Quality of Vision (QoV). Results: The LD showed an increase in all parameters in both CL modalities being significant for MV in the non-dominant eye (p < 0.030, for all LD parameters). For the MF, there was also a significant increase in LDI (p = 0.016) and in BFCrad (p = 0.022) in the non-dominant eye. After 15 days of MF lens wear, there was a significant decrease in all LD parameters (p < 0.002) in the dominant eye. Binocularly, a significant improvement from 1 to 15 days was observed for LDI (p = 0.009) and BFCrad (p = 0.0013) with MF. The QoV questionnaire showed no significant changes with neither CL. Conclusions. Adaptation to light disturbances induced by MF CL is more effective compared to MV. Practitioners will have greater success if they prepare their patients for the adaptation required as their vision will get better and have less of an issue with light disturbance. © 2018 British Contact Lens Association

Methods: This prospective, non-randomized clinical trial included 64 eyes of 32 subjects with a mean spherical equivalent -1.4 diopters (D). We evaluated changes in accommodative power, pupil diameter, astigmatic value, and axis when visual stimuli were applied to binocular, monocular (dominant eye, non-dominant eye, ipsilateral, and contralateral), and pinhole conditions. Visual stimuli were given at 0.25 D (4 m), 2 D (50 cm), 3 D (33 cm), and 4 D (25 cm) and accommodative response was evaluated using open view binocular autorefractor/keratometer. Results: The accommodative response to binocular stimulus was 90.9% of the actual refractive stimulus, while that of the monocular stimulus was 84.6%. The binocular stimulus induced a smaller pupil diameter than did the monocular stimulus. There was no difference in accommodative response between the dominant eye and non-dominant eye or between ipsilateral and contralateral stimuli. As the refractive stimuli became stronger, the absolute astigmatic value increased and the direction of the astigmatism axis became more horizontal. Pinhole glasses required 10%-15% less accommodative power compared with the monocular condition. Conclusion: Binocular stimuli enable more precise and effective accommodation than do monocular stimuli. Accommodative response is composed of 90% true accommodation and 10% pseudo-accommodation, and the refractive stimulus in one eye affects the contralateral eye to the same extent. This should be taken into account when developing guidelines for wearing smart glasses while driving, as visual stimulation is applied to only one eye, but far distance attention is constantly needed. © 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.

Neuroscientists induce visual competitions in various ways to study why and how the brain makes choices of what to perceive. Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used as models of the ventral stream of the visual system, due to similarities in both accuracy and hierarchy of feature representation. In this study we created non-dynamic visual competitions for humans by briefly presenting mixtures of two images. We then tested feed-forward DNNs with similar mixtures and examined their behavior. We found that both humans and DNNs tend to perceive only one image when presented with a mixture of two. We revealed image parameters which predict this perceptual dominance and compared their predictability for the two visual systems. Our findings can be used to both improve DNNs as models, as well as potentially improve their performance by imitating biological behaviors. © 2018 Gruber, Haruvi, Basri and Irani.

However, no eye tracking study has directly addressed this framework in the context of visual predictions of social and nonsocial stimuli. The current study used eye tracking to examine violations of learned visual associations of both social and nonsocial stimuli. Twenty-six adolescents with ASD and 18 typically developing control (TDC) adolescents completed an outcome expectation eye tracking task in which predictive cues correctly (80% of trials) or incorrectly (20% of trials) indicated the location (left or right) of forthcoming social or nonsocial stimuli. During violation trials, individuals with ASD focused their gaze relatively more often on stimuli presented on locations that violated the learned association and less often on locations that corresponded with the learned association. This finding was not moderated by stimulus type (i.e., social vs. nonsocial). Additionally, participants who looked at incorrectly predicted locations more often had significantly greater ASD symptom severity. These results are consistent with theories that characterize ASD as a disorder of prediction and have potential implications for understanding symptoms related to prediction errors in individuals with ASD.

Lay Summary: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impairments making predictions that may impact learning. In this study, we used eye tracking methodology and found that individuals with ASD were less likely to look at the predicted location when a visual routine was violated. This pattern was evident for both social and nonsocial images and was associated with greater ASD symptom severity.

Methods The medical records of patients with presumed AION who visited our hospital from January 2013 to August 2018 were examined retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: AAION associated with GCA, and non AION (NAION). We additionally reviewed the literature and identified all cases of AAION in Korean and Caucasian patients. We evaluated the clinical data including the initial and final best-corrected visual acuities, fun-dus photographs, visual field tests, fluorescein angiography, and contrast-enhanced MRI, and compared the data with those for Caucasian patients in the literature. Results Of the 142 patients with presumed AION, 3 (2.1%) were diagnosed with AAION and 139 (97.9%) were diagnosed with NAION. Seven Korean patients with AAION associated with GCA were identified in our data and the literature review. We found no difference in any clinical features other than laterality: four of the seven Korean patients had bilateral involvement. Moreover, the optic nerve sheath was enhanced in two of our Korean patients. Conclusions AAION associated with GCA is a very rare condition compared to NAION in Korea. However, GCA should be considered in all cases of ischemic optic neuropathy because AAION is associated with poor visual outcome, and sometimes presents bilaterally. © 2019 Korean Neurological Association.

People with schizophrenia suffer a wide range of social-cognitive deficits, including abnormalities in face perception. However, to date, studies of face perception in schizophrenia have primarily employed tasks that require patients to make judgements about the faces. It is, thus, unclear whether the reported deficits reflect an impairment in encoding visual face information, or biased social-cognitive evaluative processes. Methods: We assess the integrity of early unconscious face processing in 21 out-patients diagnosed with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder (15M/6F) and 21 healthy controls (14M/7F). In order to control for any direct influence of higher order cognitive processes, we use a behavioural paradigm known as breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS), where participants simply respond to the presence and location of a face. In healthy adults, this method has previously been used to show that upright faces gain rapid and privileged access to conscious awareness over inverted faces and other inanimate objects. Results: Here, we report similar effects in patients, suggesting that the early unconscious stages of face processing are intact in schizophrenia. Conclusion: Our data indicate that face processing deficits reported in the literature must manifest at a conscious stage of processing, where the influence of mentalizing or attribution biases might play a role. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Methods The mean age of the 28 participants was 38.6±8.9 years (range, 23-57 years; 6 women). A KVA metre (AS-4Fα) and FVA metre (AS-28) were used to measure KVA and FVA, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore correlations among the measured visual function and related parameters, including age, binocularity, best-corrected visual acuity, refraction and tear break-up time. Results The results of binocular KVA were better than monocular KVA at all speeds. A strong correlation was found between monocular and binocular KVA. The results of binocular FVA were better than monocular FVA (p<0.001) and there was a correlation between monocular and binocular FVA (R=0.638, p<0.001), as well as the maintenance rate for FVA (R=0.228, p=0.003). A linear mixed-effects model revealed that binocularity for KVA prediction was significant at all speeds and FVA was also significant at 60 km/h (p<0.05). Conclusion The current results suggest that both binocularity and FVA may contribute to KVA. Trial registration number UMIN00032385. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019."

When rivaling velocities were different, the participants reported center-surround segmentation: The slower stimuli often dominated in the center while faster motion persisted along the borders. The size of the central static/slow field scaled with the stimulus size. The central dominance was time-locked to the static stimulus onset but was disrupted if the dynamic stimulus was presented later. We then used the same stimuli as masks in an interocular suppression paradigm. The local suppression strengths were probed with targets at different eccentricities. Consistent with the centersurround segmentation, target speed and location interacted with mask velocities. Specifically, suppression power of the slower masks was nonhomogenous with eccentricity, providing a potential explanation for centersurround velocity-based segmentation. This interaction of speed, eccentricity, and timing has implications for motion processing and interocular suppression. The influence of different masks on which target features get suppressed predicts that some ''unconscious effects'' are not generalizable across masks and, thus, need to be replicated under various masking conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

Due to the complexity of human visual system (HVS) and the incomprehensive study of stereoscopic perception of human eyes, stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) is still a challenging task. In this paper, combining binocular characteristics, we propose an efficient no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment according to binocular adding and subtracting channels. Distinguished from other SIQA methods, which pay attention to complex binocular visual properties, the visual information which is closely bound up with image distortion from adding and subtracting channels to describe ocular dominance (alternate name binocularity) is proposed. To estimate the contribution of each channel in SIQA, a dynamic weighting system is proposed for binocular fusion according to local energy. Furthermore, quality awareness features based on multi-scale and multi-orientation are extracted to describe visual degradation. Comparing with existing methods, experimental results on public 3D image databases demonstrate the proposed framework achieves high consistent with the subjective quality scores. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We examined whether these binocular advantages derive from increased reliability in encoding the goal object’s properties for feedforward planning of prehension movements or from enhanced feedback mediating their online control. Adult participants reached for, precision grasped and lifted cylindrical table-top objects (two sizes, 2 distances) using binocular vision or only their dominant/sighting eye or their non-dominant eye to program and fully execute their movements or using each of the three viewing conditions only to plan their reach-to-grasp during a 1 s preview, with vision occluded just before movement onset. Various kinematic measures of reaching and grasping proficiency, including corrective error rates, were quantified and compared by view, feedback and object type. Some significant benefits of binocular over monocular vision when they were just available for pre-movement planning were retained for the reach regardless of target distance, including higher peak velocities, straighter paths and shorter low velocity approach times, although these latter were contaminated by more velocity corrections and by poorer coordination with object contact. By contrast, virtually all binocular advantages for grasping, including improvements in peak grip aperture scaling, the accuracy and precision of digit placements at object contact and shorter grip application times preceding the lift, were eliminated with no feedback available, outcomes that were influenced by the object’s size. We argue that vergence cues can improve the reliability of binocular internal representations of object distance for the feedforward programming of hand transport, whereas the major benefits of binocular vision for enhancing grasping performance derive exclusively from its continuous presence online. © 2019, The Author(s).

Lab-based tests of sensory eye dominance (SED) are commonplace, but have not been translated to wider clinical practice. Here we compare several methods of quantifying SED in a format suitable for clinical use. We tested 30 participants with ostensibly normal vision on eight tests. Seven tests (#1–7) were designed to quantify SED in the form of an interocular balance-point (BP). In tests #1–6, we estimated a contrast-BP, the interocular difference in contrast required for observers to be equally likely to base their judgement on either eye, whereas in test #7 we measured binocular rivalry (interocular ratio of sensory dominance duration). We compare test-retest reliability (intra-observer consistency) and test-validity (inter-observer discriminatory power) and compare BP to stereoacuity (test #8). The test that best preserved inter-observer differences in contrast balance while maintaining good test-retest reliability was a polarity judgement using superimposed opposite-contrast polarity same-identity optotypes. A reliable and valid measure of SED can be obtained rapidly (20 trials) using a simple contrast-polarity judgement. Tests that use polarity-rivalrous stimuli elicit more reliable judgments than those that do not. Significance Statement: Although sensory eye dominance is central to understanding normal and disordered binocular vision, there is currently no consensus as to the best way to measure it. Here we compare several candidate measures of sensory eye dominance and conclude that a reliable measure of SED can be achieved rapidly using a judgement of stimulus contrast-polarity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

In this article, we survey recent progress in basic research that uses AR to explore the plasticity of the adult visual system. We focus on a particular application of AR called altered reality, which has been used to shed new light on mechanisms of long-term contrast adaptation and ocular-dominance plasticity.

The purpose of this study was to examine the laterality of high-level football players and its effects on 180° left and right U-turn movements. Materials and Methods: Handedness, footedness, and eyedness were determined in 72 elite football players (EFP, 18.2 ± 2.2 years) from the Stade Rennais Football Club (French League 1) and 9 amateur football players (AFP, 19.6 ± 2.1 years). Players performed a visual-motor task on a synthetic pitch consisting of 180° left and right rotations as fast as possible in response to a visual light on a computer screen. Movement times and reactive times for each left and right rotation were recorded with an accelerometer and video display. Results: Laterality profiles showed a majority (χ2 = 9.42, df = 2, p = 0.031) of crossed formulas (i.e., dominant leg or hand is controlateral to the dominant eye) for EFP (53 ± 7%) and a majority of non-crossed formulas for AFP (63 ± 9%). Reaction times were significantly faster (p = 0.028, effect size = 0.148, trivial) in EFP right-eyed (568.2 ± 55.5 ms) than in AFP (610.0 ± 43.9 ms). For the left rotation and for right-footed players, movement times were significantly different (p = 0.043, effect size = 0.413, small) between EFP (1.15 ± 0.07 s) and AFP (1.17 ± 0.07 s). A significant difference (p < 0.033) was observed between footedness and rotation movement times in the EFP. Conclusion: Our results showed that laterality profiles differed between EFP and AFP. Hence, in EFP, reaction times depended on the side of the visual stimulus. Moreover, leg laterality of EFP influenced 180° left or right rotation speed. Our results indicate the importance of determining laterality in soccer players and identifying deficits in performance when turning. © 2018 Zouhal, Abderrahman, Dupont, Truptin, Le Bris, Le Postec, Coppalle, Ravé, Brughelli and Bideau.

In this study, we investigated the brain intrinsic activity of either the EO or EC states by using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 22 healthy participants. The 10 resting-state networks (RSNs) of these participants were explored by the independent component analysis method. Within each RSN, various network parameters (i.e., the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, the voxel-wise weighted degree centrality, and the RSN-wise functional connectivity) were measured to depict the brain intrinsic activity properties underlying the EO and EC states. Taking these brain intrinsic activity properties as discriminative features in a linear classifier, we found that the EO and EC states could be effectively classified using the intrinsic properties of the sensory dominance networks and the salience network (SN). Further analysis showed that the brain intrinsic activity within the sensory dominance networks was constantly overwhelmed during the EC state relative to that in the EO state. The SN might play a key role as a switcher between state-switching. Therefore, this study indicated that the brain intrinsic activity in the sensory dominance networks would be enhanced with EC, which might improve other sensory-relative task performance. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers."

Methods: Contrast sensitivity measurements were obtained by presenting eight horizontal sine-wave gratings (ranging from 0.2 to 20 cycles per degree). A three-up-one-down method was used to obtain thresholds with a criterion of 79.4% correct responses for each spatial frequency. The mean of 12 reversals was used for obtaining thresholds, and the two-alternative forced-choice method was used. Data were recorded in 55 naive observers from 20 to 45 years. All participants were free from identifiable ocular disease and had normal visual acuity. Results: We observed the absence of differences on CSF for both monocular and binocular observers, as well as the absence of differences between large sample sizes. The latter investigation revealed a high degree of repeatability across time (baseline to 6 months later) with the higher test–retest for low and high spatial frequencies. Conclusions: Our results indicated that spatial contrast sensitivity measurements were little influenced by variables, such as binocular summation, eye dominance, sample size and time using the Metropsis test. The results obtained here have significance for basic and clinical vision science. © 2019, The Royal College of Ophthalmologists."

There are differences in resolution not only between the fovea and regions eccentric to it, but also between the nasal and temporal hemiretinae, that can be traced to asymmetric distributions of photoreceptors and ganglion cells. We review evidence for differences in visual and attentional processing and oculomotor behaviour that can be traced to asymmetries of the visual system, mainly emphasising nasal-temporal asymmetries. Asymmetries in the visual system manifest in various measures, in basic psychophysical tests of visual performance, attentional processing, choice behaviour, saccadic peak velocity, and latencies. Nasal-temporal asymmetries on saccadic latency seem primarily to occur for express saccades. Neural asymmetries between the upper and lower hemifields are strong and cause corresponding differences in performance between the hemifields. There are interesting individual differences in asymmetric processing which seem to be related to the strength of eye dominance. These neurophysiological asymmetries and the corresponding asymmetries in visual performance and oculomotor behaviour can strongly influence experimental results in vision and must be considered during experimental design and the interpretation of results. © 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the third intron of the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene is highly associated with FECD. However, only about 75% of FECD patients in the northern European population possess an expansion of this repeat. The remaining FECD cases appear to be associated with variants in other genes. To better understand the pathophysiology of this disease, we compared gene expression profiles of corneal endothelium from FECD patients with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (RE+) to those that do not have a repeat expansion (RE-). Comparative analysis of these two cohorts showed widespread RNA mis-splicing in RE+, but not in RE- samples. Quantitatively, we identified 39 genes in which expression was significantly different between RE+ and RE- samples. Examination of the mutation profiles in the RE- samples did not find any mutations in genes previously associated with FECD, but did reveal one sample with a rare variant of laminin subunit gamma 1 (LAMC1) and three samples with rare variants in the gene coding for the mitochondrial protein peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 1 (TSPOAP1). © 2018 Wieben et al.

A primary drawback in exposure-based therapies is the high rate of relapse that occurs when higher order areas fail to inhibit responses driven by the defensive circuit. It has been shown that implicit exposure of fearful stimuli leads to a long-lasting reduction in avoidance behavior in patients with phobia. Despite the potential benefits of this approach in the treatment of phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder, implicit extinction is still underinvestigated. Methods: Two groups of healthy participants were threat conditioned. The following day, extinction training was conducted using a stereoscope. One group of participants was explicitly exposed with the threat-conditioned image, while the other group was implicitly exposed using a continuous flash suppression (CFS) technique. On the third day, we tested the spontaneous recovery of defensive responses using explicit presentations of the images. Results: On the third day, we found that only the implicit extinction group showed reduced spontaneous recovery of defensive responses to the threat-conditioned stimulus, measured by threat-potentiated startle responses but not by the electrodermal activity. Conclusion: Our results suggest that implicit extinction using CFS might facilitate the modulation of the affective component of fearful memories, attenuating its expression after 24 hr. The limitations of the CFS technique using threatful stimuli urge the development of new strategies to improve implicit presentations and circumvent such limitations. Our study encourages further investigations of implicit extinction as a potential therapeutic target to further advance exposure-based psychotherapies. © 2018 The Authors.

Other vision-associated areas may also be affected, including the corpus callosum which is involved in inter-hemispheric transfer. This study evaluated dominance wave propagation during binocular rivalry to probe the efficacy of the inter-hemispheric transfer in 20 patients with mild open angle glaucoma and 25 age-matched controls. The two groups were matched for functional measures such as stereo-acuity, binocular visual acuity, and visual field mean deviation. Monocular functional and structural measures were equivalent for the left and right eye of each participant. Using Wilson et al.’s travelling wave paradigm [Nature, 412 (2001) 907–910], intra- and inter-hemispheric failure rates of traveling wave transmission and the travelling wave propagation times were recorded for the two groups. For the control group, the wave propagation failure rate was significantly greater for the inter- than for the intra-hemispheric condition, but for the glaucoma group, the failure rates were equally high for the two conditions. The wave propagation time was significantly longer for the inter- than for the intra-hemispheric condition for the control group, while the opposite was true for the glaucoma group. These results reveal changes in the wave dynamics of rivalry dominance in patients with mild glaucoma who otherwise have normal performance on standard functional measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

The experiment selects 25 college students with right eye dominance and 25 college students with left eye dominance as viewers. They are interested in new technologies and volunteered to experience watching the autostereoscopic display. They passed the appropriate exercise. In the experiment, the viewers move left and right to see the video played by the three-dimension lenticular display and record the subjective feelings in real time while measuring the angle between the eyes and the plane of the display by using a compass. The obtained data are used to analyze the effect of dominant eye on autostereoscopic display. The results show that there are two main differences in the viewing experience between different dominant eye viewers. The first point is the viewers feel the jump clearly when the dominant eye goes through the transition area. And the second point is the different dominant eye viewers have different viewing experience and viewing angles when they watch the three-dimension lenticular display at the same location in the viewing area. The research provides a reference for the development of the three-dimension lenticular display. © 2018, Science Press. All rights reserved.

Our results suggest that the perceived centre of a peripherally viewed expanding pattern is shifted towards the fovea relative to that of a contracting pattern, but only in the lower right and upper right visual quadrants and when a single speed gradient with appropriate overall speeds of the trajectories of the moving dots was used. The biases were not systematically related to differences of sensitivity to optic flow in different quadrants. Further experiments demonstrated that the biases were likely due to a combination of two effects: an advantage of global processing in favor of the lower visual hemifield and a hemispheric asymmetry in attentional allocation in favor of motion-induced spatial displacement in the right visual hemifield. The bias in the lower right visual quadrant was speed gradient-sensitive and could be reduced to a non-significant level with the usage of multiple speed gradients, possibly due to a special role of the lower visual hemifield in extracting global information from the multiple speed gradients. A holistic processing on multiple speed gradients, rather than a predominant processing on a single speed gradient, was likely adopted. In contrast, the perceived bias in the upper right visual quadrant was overall speed-sensitive and could be reduced to a non-significant level with the reduction of the overall speeds of the trajectories. The implications of these results for understanding motion-induced spatial illusions are discussed. © 2019 Cheng et al.

Levelt’s first law predicts that a highly visible stimulus will predominate over a less visible stimulus during binocular rivalry. In a behavioural study, we made a counterintuitive observation: high visibility patterns do not always predominate over low visibility patterns. Our results show that none of Levelt’s binocular rivalry laws hold when luminance-modulated (LM) patterns compete with contrast-modulated (CM) patterns. We discuss visual saliency, asymmetric feedback, and a combination of both as potential mechanisms to explain the CM versus LM findings. Competing orthogonal LM stimuli do follow Levelt’s laws, whereas only the first two laws hold for competing CM stimuli. The current results provide strong psychophysical evidence for the existence of separate processing stages for LM and CM stimuli. © 2018, The Author(s).

In this study, we explored three mechanisms: haptic feedback, transfer-appropriate processing and stereoscopic vision. Methods: The test of these hypotheses required nine groups of 20 students: two from a previous study (Anat Sci Educ, 6 [4], 211, 2013) and seven new groups. (i) To explore haptic feedback from physical models, participants in one group were allowed to touch the model during learning; in the other group, they could not; (ii) to test ‘transfer-appropriate processing’ (TAP), learning (PM or 3DVT) was crossed with testing (cadaver or two-dimensional display of cadaver); (iii) finally, to examine the role of stereo vision, we tested groups who had the non-dominant eye covered during learning and testing, during learning, or not at all, on both PM and 3DVT. The test was a 15-item short-answer test requiring naming structures on a cadaver pelvis. A list of names was provided. Results: The test of haptic feedback showed a large advantage of the PM over 3DVT regardless of whether or not participants had haptic feedback: 67% correct for the PM with haptic feedback, 69% for PM without haptic feedback, versus 41% for 3DVT (p < 0.0001). In the study of TAP, the PM had an average score of 74% versus 43% for 3DVT (p < 0.0001) regardless of two-dimensional versus three-dimensional test outcome. The third study showed that the large advantage of the PM over 3DVT (28%) with binocular vision nearly disappeared (5%) when the non-dominant eye was covered for both learning and testing. Conclusions: A physical model is superior to a computer projection, primarily as a consequence of stereoscopic vision with the PM. The results have implications for the use of digital technology in spatial learning. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education"

However, how spatial reorganization works is still unclear. A limitation of the study on blindness is that it is a “stable” system and it does not allow for studying the mechanisms that subtend the progress of this reorganization. To overcome this problem here we study, for the first time, audio spatial reorganization in 18 adults with macular degeneration (MD) for which the loss of vision due to scotoma is an ongoing progressive process. Our results show that the loss of vision produces immediate changes in the processing of spatial audio signals. In individuals with MD, the lateral sounds are “attracted” toward the central scotoma position resulting in a strong bias in the spatial auditory percept. This result suggests that the reorganization of audio space representation is a fast and plastic process occurring also later in life, after vision loss. © Copyright © 2019 Ahmad, Setti, Campus, Capris, Facchini, Sandini and Gori.

We investigated whether the ocular dominance shift could be accumulated across multiple periods of monocular deprivation over consecutive days. We used a binocular phase combination task to measure the shift in eye dominance. We patched the dominant eye of ten adults with normal vision for two hours across five consecutive days. Our results show no cumulative effect after repeated sessions of short-term monocular deprivation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

In Lobe (L) mutant flies, parts of the eye or even the complete eye are absent because the eye field has not been properly defined. Manifold genetic interactions indicate that L influences the activity of several signalling pathways, resulting in a conversion of eye tissue into epidermis, and in the induction of apoptosis. As information on the molecular nature of the L mutation is lacking, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still an enigma. Results: We have identified Protein Kinase D (PKD) as a strong modifier of the L mutant phenotype. PKD belongs to the PKC/CAMK class of Ser/Thr kinases that have been involved in diverse cellular processes including stress resistance and growth. Despite the many roles of PKD, Drosophila PKD null mutants are without apparent phenotype apart from sensitivity to oxidative stress. Here we report an involvement of PKD in eye development in the sensitized genetic background of Lobe. Absence of PKD strongly enhanced the dominant eye defects of heterozygous L 2 flies, and decreased their viability. Moreover, eye-specific overexpression of an activated isoform of PKD considerably ameliorated the dominant L 2 phenotype. This genetic interaction was not allele specific but similarly seen with three additional, weaker L alleles (L 1, L 5, L G ), demonstrating its specificity. Conclusions: We propose that PKD-mediated phosphorylation is involved in underlying processes causing the L phenotype, i.e. in the regulation of growth, the epidermal transformation of eye tissue and apoptosis, respectively. © 2019 The Author(s).

Notably, saccadic peak velocity is higher in temporal than in nasal saccades, and in centripetal than in centrifugal saccades. It has already been shown that eye dominance strength relates to naso-temporal asymmetry, but its links with centripetal-centrifugal asymmetry has never been tested. The current study tested both naso-temporal and centripetal-centrifugal asymmetries simultaneously to provide a finer and continuous measure of eye dominance strength. We asked 63 participants to make centripetal and centrifugal saccades from five different locations. Analysis of saccadic peak velocity shows that eye dominance strength modulates every saccadic asymmetry tested. For the first time, we propose a graduated measure of eye dominance strength on a continuum model. The model ranges from weak to very strong eye dominance. Weak eye dominance corresponds to increased saccadic asymmetries whereas strong eye dominance corresponds to no asymmetries. Furthermore, our results provide new insights into the neurophysiological origins of saccadic asymmetries. Modulation of both naso-temporal and centripetal-centrifugal asymmetries by eye dominance strength supports the involvement of V1 in these saccadic asymmetries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Transverse sinus (TS) asymmetry might cause diagnostic challenges with regards to thrombotic or compressive pathologies involving these sinuses. In this study, we investigated the association between occipital petalia and TS hypoplasia on MRI studies. Methods: In 264 subjects with no neurological complaints, occipital bending was determined on T1-weighted images based on the angulation of interhemispheric fissure between occipital lobes with respect to an imaginary midline. TS asymmetry was evaluated visually. Information on handedness and ocular dominance was also gathered from all participants. Results: Rightwards bending was observed in 72 subjects (27%), whereas leftwards bending was present in only 10 participants (4%). The presence or direction of bending was related neither to hand nor ocular dominance. In participants with rightwards bending, 72% had a larger TS on the right-side, while only a single subject had a left-sided predilection for venous drainage. In subjects with leftwards bending, 70% had a left-dominant TS drainage system and none had a larger TS on the right. Overall, the direction of bending was predictive of TS dominance on the ipsilateral side with a PPV of 72% (95%CI, 60–82%) for right and 70% (95%CI, 35–92%) for left. Discussion: The direction of bending, a relatively straightforward radiologic diagnosis, is closely linked to the side of TS hypoplasia, and thereby might provide physicians with an additional diagnostic clue regarding the interpretation of imaging findings related to TSs and their pathologies. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

METHODS: The extended depth of focus (EDOF) only group (n = 40 eyes) was implanted bilaterally with an EDOF intraocular lens (IOL) and the mixed group (n = 40 eyes) was implanted with the same EDOF IOL in the dominant eye and a trifocal IOL in the fellow eye. At the 3-month postoperative visit, refractive outcomes and monocular and binocular uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities for far UDVA, CDVA, distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at 80 cm, uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA), distancecorrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 40 cm, and binocular defocus curve were evaluated.

In this study, we aimed to compare the precision of a binocular orientation combination paradigm with that of the standard binocular phase combination paradigm in measuring the binocular eye balance at low to high spatial frequencies. Nine normal adults (average age: 24.6 ± 2.0 years old) participated. Subjects viewed an LED screen dichoptically with polarized glasses in a dark room. The method of constant stimuli was used to quantitatively assess the point of subjective equality (PSE), i.e., the interocular contrast ratio when two eyes are balanced in binocular combination, for stimulus spatial frequencies from 0.5 to 8 cycles/degree. Precision was quantified by the variance [i.e., standard error (SE), obtained from 100 bootstrap estimates] associated to the PSE. Using stimuli whose interocular phase difference at the edge of the gratings was matched at 45°, we found that the orientation paradigm provides more precision than the standard binocular phase combination paradigm, especially at high frequencies (Experiment 1). Such differences remained when using stimuli that had three times larger interocular phase difference (Experiment 2) or displayed at four times higher stimuli resolution (Experiment 3). Our results indicate that a binocular combination tasked based on orientation rather than phase, provides a more precise estimate of binocular eye balance in human adults at high spatial frequencies, thus allowing a binocular balance to be assessed within the spatial region where amblyopes are most defective (i.e., high spatial frequencies). © 2019 Wang, He, Liang, Chen, Gong, Mao, Chen, Yao, Spiegel, Qu, Lu, Zhou and Hess.

At present, there are few studies on how to comprehensively evaluate athletes’ stereoscopic function and how the impairment of stereoscopic function affects sports performance. METHODS: Twenty-two professional table-tennis players from Sichuan Province Team were recruited as player group and 23 age-matched students were recruited as the controls. All subjects were measured the habitual visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity, dominant eye, retinoscopy and three stereo acuity tests. Both groups completed two motor skills tasks: Purdue Pegboard and beads threading with habitual binocular viewing and monocular viewing by covering dominant eye. In addition, the player group was asked to complete a brief questionnaire and catch balls served by the auto table-tennis machine under two viewing conditions. RESULTS: The player group had better stereo acuity with median values of 60, 25 and 40 arc sec in TNO, Butterfly, and Frisby tests, respectively. There had statistically correlations between stereo acuity and two motor skills tasks. Both the two tasks were statistically significant different between binocular and monocular viewings in both groups. The player group had better performance on Purdue Pegboard task with binocular viewing (16±1.1, P=0.006) compared to the control group, while no statistical difference was found under monocular condition in beads threading task.

Methods: Forty presbyopic participants (mean age, 48.7±3.4) presenting a mean addition of 1.53±0.58 D were fitted with Biofinity Multifocal (CooperVision) and included in the study. Measurements comprised distance and near monocular high (100%) and low contrast (10%) logMAR visual acuity (VA). Ocular aberrations were obtained with Hartmann-Shack aberrometer (IRX3, Imagine Eyes) and analyzed for 2 mm and maximum round natural pupil. Results: Distance VA was significantly higher in dominant eye, whereas near VA was significantly better in the non-dominant eye (P<0.05 in all conditions). For a 2-mm pupil in the dominant eye fitted with MFCL, spherical-like aberration significantly increased (P=0.027) so as higherorder aberrations (HOA) (P=0.002). A significant increase was also observed in spherical-like aberrations (P=0.001), coma-like aberrations (P=0.006) and HOA (P=0.004) in non-dominant eye. For the maximum round natural pupil size, a significant decrease in vertical coma was observed (P=0.018) in dominant eye, whereas a significant increase in spherical-like (P<0.001) and coma-like aberrations (P=0.007) was observed in non-dominant eye. A negative significant correlation was found between vertical coma and high contrast VA (Rho=20.405, P=0.011) in dominant eye; whereas in non-dominant eye, a significant correlation was found between induced secondary astigmatism and distance VA under high (Rho=0.556, P<0.001) and low contrast (Rho=0.448, P=0.005). Conclusions: On-eye visual performance of MFSCL is dependent on the high-order aberrations induced by dominant and non-dominant design coupled with the wearer's inherent aberrations. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Amblyopia is often referred to as lazy eye, and it entails weaker vision in one eye due to a poor connection between the eye and the brain. Until recently it was thought to be untreatable in adults, but new research has proven that with consistent therapy even adults can improve their Amblyopia, especially through perceptual learning and video games. Even so, therapy compliance remains low due to the fact that conventional therapies are perceived as either invasive, dull and/or boring. Our game aims to make Amblyopia therapy more immersive, enjoyable and playful. The game was perceived by our users to be a fun and accessible alternative, as it involves adhering a Bangerter foil (an opaque sticker) on a VR headset to blur vision in an Amblyopic person's dominant eye while having them playa VR video game. To perform well in the video game, their brain must adapt to rely on seeing with their weaker eye, thereby reforging that neurological connection. While testing our game, we also studied users behavior to investigate what visual and kinetic components were more effective therapeutically. Our findings generally show positive results, showing that visual acuity in adults increases with 45 minutes of therapy. Amblyopia has many negative symptoms including poor depth perception (nec-essary for daily activities such as driving), so this therapy could be life changing for adults with Amblyopia. © 2019 IEEE.

Methods: Literature review. Results: Monovision with excimer laser traditionally applies near correction to the non-dominant eye. Different excimer laser presbyopic approaches include the increase in depth of focus, through the controlled change of spherical aberration or asphericity, or multifocal ablation patterns with central or peripheral near vision zones. The studies investigating different excimer laser ablation patterns applied in previously myopic eyes revealed high levels of efficacy with all ablation profiles (between 68% and 99% achieving binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity [UDVA] of 20/25 or better, and between 70% and 100% achieving uncorrected near visual acuity [UNVA] presenting J3 or better). In hypermetropic eyes, most of the studies revealed high levels of efficacy with different platforms (between 78% and 100% achieving binocular UDVA of 20/25 or better and between 70% and 100% achieving UNVA presenting J3 or better). Loss of two or more lines of corrected distance visual acuity varied between 0% and 10% in the myopic eyes and between 0% and 14% in the hyperopic eyes. Conclusions: There is evidence that excimer laser presbyopic strategies accomplish spectacle independence at reasonable levels. There are reliable and safe options for both myopic and hyperopic eyes with satisfactory outcomes regarding near and distance vision. © 2018 SLACK Incorporated.

This is evidenced in illusions such as the McGurk effect, in which a seen mouth movement changes the perceived sound. The current paper assessed the effects of manipulating the clarity of the heard and seen signal upon the McGurk effect in children aged 3–6 (n = 29), 7–9 (n = 32) and 10–12 (n = 29) years, and adults aged 20–35 years (n = 32). Auditory noise increased, and visual blur decreased, the likelihood of vision changing auditory perception. Based upon a proposed developmental shift from auditory to visual dominance we predicted that younger children would be less susceptible to McGurk responses, and that adults would continue to be influenced by vision in higher levels of visual noise and with less auditory noise. Susceptibility to the McGurk effect was higher in adults compared with 3–6-year-olds and 7–9-year-olds but not 10–12-year-olds. Younger children required more auditory noise, and less visual noise, than adults to induce McGurk responses (i.e. adults and older children were more easily influenced by vision). Reduced susceptibility in childhood supports the theory that sensory dominance shifts across development and reaches adult-like levels by 10 years of age. © 2018, The Author(s).

Our primary hypothesis was that OT would improve recognition of happy faces in depressed participants. The main effect of OT on ER accuracy, speed, and proportion of fixations in the eye region was not significant. Diagnostic group (i.e., presence/absence of a depressive disorder) moderated the effect of OT on ER, but not as expected: OT significantly slowed ER speed for all emotions in participants with anxiety disorders, but did not affect performance in participants with depressive disorders. Depressed participants fixated significantly less in the eye region of sad faces than anxious participants. Before OT can be used to target ER biases, additional research is needed to explicate the differential impact of OT on ER speed in patients with anxiety versus mood disorders. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

However, not all of these visual-field asymmetries (VFAs) have been observed consistently. Moreover, it is typically unclear whether a failure to observe a particular VFA can be ascribed to certain characteristics of the participants and stimuli, to a lack of statistical power, or to the actual absence of an effect. To increase our understanding of lateralization of visual information processing, we have taken a rigorous methodological and statistical approach to examine the reproducibility of various previously reported VFAs. We did so by performing (near-)exact replications of nine representative previous studies, aiming for sufficient power to detect the effects of interest, and taking into consideration all relevant dependent variables (reaction times and error rates). Following Bayesian analyses –on our data alone as well as on the combined evidence from the original and replication studies– we find precise and reliable evidence that support VFAs in the processing of faces, emotional expressions, global and local information, words, and in the distribution of spatial attention. In contrast, we find less convincing evidence for VFAs in processing of high and low spatial frequencies. Finally, we find no evidence for VFAs in categorical perception of color and shape oddballs, and in the judgments of categorical and coordinate spatial relations. We discuss our results in the light of their implications for theories of visual lateralization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Methods Healthy dominant eyes of 34 presbyopes were examined for visual performance in 3 trials: reference (with lens for distance correction); stenopeic (distance correction with a pinhole ϕ = 1.25 mm) and Light Sword Lens (distance correction with a Light Sword Lens). In each trial, visual acuity was assessed in 7 tasks for defocus from 0.2D to 3.0D while contrast sensitivity in 2 tasks for defocus 0.3D and 2.5D. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol and Pelli-Robson method were applied. Within visual acuity and contrast sensitivity results degree of homogeneity through defocus was determined. Reference and stenopeic trials were compared to Light Sword Lens results. Friedman analysis of variance, Nemenyi post-hoc, Wilcoxon tests were used, p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results In Light Sword Lens trial visual acuity was stable in tested defocus range [20/25-20/32], Ste-nopeic trial exhibited a limited range of degradation [20/25-20/40]. Light Sword Lens and reference trials contrast sensitivity was high [1.9-2.0 logCS] for both defocus cases, but low in stenopeic condition [1.5-1.7 logCS]. Between-trials comparisons of visual acuity results showed significant differences only for Light Sword Lens versus reference trials and in contrast sensitivity only for Light Sword Lens versus stenopeic trials. Conclusions Visual acuity achieved with Light Sword Lens correction in presbyopic eye is comparable to stenopeic but exhibits none significant loss in contrast sensitivity. Such correction method seems to be very promising for novel contact lenses and intraocular lenses design. © 2019 Petelczyc et al.

PURPOSE This study compared the agreement between open-field autorefraction and a modified dynamic retinoscopy for the objective measurement of AA. METHODS Accommodative amplitude was measured using two objective techniques for subjects aged 5 to 60 years. Test order was randomized and monocular AA was measured as subjects viewed printed letters 0.9 mm in height with their dominant eye and distance refraction. For retinoscopy, subjects held a near rod and viewed the target at the nearest (most proximal) point of clear vision. The examiner then performed dynamic retinoscopy along the horizontal meridian and identified the physical location of neutrality of the reflex, which was converted to AA in diopters. Autorefraction was performed obtaining repeated measures of refraction beginning from a target demand of 2.5 D and increasing in discrete steps until there was no subsequent increase in accommodative response. Refractions were converted to power in the horizontal meridian and expressed as accommodation in diopters with the maximal value termed the AA. Distance overrefractions were measured for both techniques to adjust AA for any uncorrected refractive error. Difference versus mean analysis was used to compare agreement between tests. RESULTS The 95% limits of agreement between techniques were calculated after removal of two young outliers who responded poorly to one of the techniques. The overall mean difference for 95 subjects was 0.02 ± 0.97 D, with limits of agreement spanning -1.87 to 1.92 D. No significant linear relationship between the magnitude of the AA and the differences between techniques was observed. CONCLUSIONS Agreement between dynamic retinoscopy and open-field autorefraction was less than 2 D with no systematic bias, suggesting that dynamic retinoscopy may be a suitable clinical technique to measure objective AA. © 2019 American Academy of Optometry.
"Wang M.; McGraw P.; Ledgeway T.";0.0;Individual variation in inter-ocular suppression and sensory eye dominance;2019;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2019.07.004;The competitive and inhibitory interactions between the two eyes’ images are a pervasive aspect of binocular vision. Over the last decade, our understanding of the neural processes underpinning binocular rivalry (BR) and continuous flash suppression (CFS) has increased substantially, but we still have little understanding of the relationship between these two effects and their variation in the general population. Studies that pool data across individuals and eyes risk masking substantial variations in binocular vision that exist in the general population. To investigate this issue we compared the depth of inter-ocular suppression evoked by BR with that elicited by CFS, in a group (N = 25) of visually normal individuals. A noise pattern (either static for BR or dynamic for CFS) was presented to one eye and its suppressive influence on a probe grating presented simultaneously to the other eye was measured. We found substantial individual differences in the magnitude of suppression (a 10-fold variation in probe detection threshold) evoked by each task, but performance on BR was a significant predictor of performance on the CFS task. However many individuals showed marked asymmetries between the two eyes’ ability to detect a suppressed target, that were not necessarily the same for the two tasks. There was a tendency for the magnitude of the asymmetry to increase as the refresh rate of the dynamic noise increased. The results suggest a common underlying mechanism is likely to be responsible, at least in part, for driving inter-ocular suppression under BR and CFS. The marked asymmetries in inter-ocular suppression at higher noise refresh rates, may be indicative of a difference in temporal processing between the eyes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

We presumed that these blur differences cause suppression of the more blurred image (interocular blur suppression, IOBS), disrupt binocular fusion and suppressed eye leaves its forced vergent position. During dichoptic presentation of static grayscale images of natural scenes, the luminance contrast (mode B) or higher-spatial frequency content (mode C) or luminance contrast plus higherspatial frequency content (mode A) were stepwise reduced in the image presented to the non-dominant eye. We studied the effect of these types of blur on fusion stability at various levels of the vergence demand. During the divergence demand, the fusion was disrupted with approximately half blur than during convergence. Various modes of blur influenced fusion differently. The mode C (isolated reduction of higher-spatial frequency content) violated fusion under the lowest vergence demand significantly more than either isolated or combined reduction of luminance contrast (mode B and A). According to our results, the image's details (i.e. higher-spatial frequency content) protects binocular fusion from disruption by the lowest vergence demand. © 2019 International Group for Eye Movement Research.

This study explored a range of common landscape and hardscape features to learn which were preferred by park users over age 60. This photo comparison study hypothesized that older adults would prefer certain features of urban park walkways, with each feature represented by four different paired images (28 pairs in all). Within each pair of photos, both were identical except for the specific feature being tested in that comparison, where the image was digitally modified to depict the hypothesized feature. A total of 283 older adults (mean age 71 years) completed the survey by selecting the images they preferred. In this Chinese sample, older park users significantly favored all seven hypothesized walkway features, providing empirical support for the existing research and design-based literature on green space for older adults. This study found minor gender differences in visual preferences for walkway features and increasing preference for access to seating with advancing age. By helping to confirm which walkway features are preferred by older adults, these findings can be used to improve the future design and management of urban parks in China, which are an important source of exercise and recreation for nearby elderly residents. © 2019 by the authors.

Therapies in Ophthalmology;10.24292/01.OT.311219.04;According to the World Health Organization, amblyopia and associated uncorrected refractive errors are the most common causes of visual disorders. Amblyopia is defined as the reduction of the best-corrected visual acuity in one or, less frequently, in both eyes. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs in childhood and results in the discontinuation of normal cortical visual pathways. Until recently, it was believed that due to the lack of sufficient plasticity of the central nervous system in adults, amblyopia is incurable after the end of the critical period, i.e. around 7 years of age. However, recent research results undermined this view, revealing underestimated recovery potential even in adulthood. Traditional methods of amblyopia treatment include correction of refractive errors and stimulation of the visually impaired eye by covering the dominant eye, most often by obturation or pharmacological penalisation with atropine. Preliminary results of research on modern methods of therapy, such as video games, perceptual learning or dichoptic training, provide opportunities not only to improve visual acuity, but also to relieve other visual deficiencies associated with ambliopia, such as reduced sensitivity to contrast or spatial vision.

It is however not clear how much monocular training can enhance binocular visual functions. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate effects of monocular training on a variety of binocular functions. Nineteen anisometropic amblyopes (18.5 ± 1.26 yrs, mean ± s.e.) were trained in a grating contrast detection task near each individual's cutoff spatial frequency for 6–10 days (630 trials/day). Visual acuity, stereoacuity, monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity functions (CSF), binocular phase combination and binocular rivalry were tested before and after training. Although monocular training can improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and eye dominance of the amblyopic eye, the magnitudes of improvements did not correlate with each other; the impact of monocular training on binocular phase combination was not significant. The results strongly suggest that structured monocular and binocular training is needed to fully recover deficient visual functions in anisometropic amblyopia. © 2017 The Author(s)"

Due to current pointing models’ inherent inaccuracies, most of the systems using pointing gestures so far rely on visual feedback showing users where they point at. However, in many environments, e.g., smart homes, it is rarely possible to display cursors since most devices do not contain a display. Therefore, we raise the question of how to facilitate accurate pointing-based interaction in a cursorless context. In this paper we present two user studies showing that previous cursorless techniques are rather inaccurate as they lack important considerations about users’ characteristics that would help in minimizing inaccuracy. We show that pointing accuracy could be significantly improved by acknowledging users’ handedness and ocular dominance. In a first user study (n= 33), we reveal the large effect of ocular dominance and handedness on human pointing behavior. Current ray-casting techniques neglect both ocular dominance and handedness as effects onto pointing behavior, precluding them from accurate cursorless selection. With a second user study (n= 25), we show that accounting for ocular dominance and handedness yields to significantly more accurate selections compared to two previously published ray-casting techniques. This speaks for the importance of considering users’ characteristics further to develop better selection techniques to foster more robust accurate selections. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

Methods: Volunteers without prior eyelid or forehead pathologic study were recruited for this nonrandomized, prospective study. Baseline and study phase brow positions were documented. The first phase was to simulate visual deprivation and the second to simulate ptosis. The dominant eye was used for each phase. As a proxy to simulate visual field deprivation, a black contact lens was placed on the eye, which reduced vision to light perception. As a proxy to simulate ptosis, an external eyelid weight was placed on the upper eyelid. Brow position ratios were calculated at various points along the brow and statistical analysis was performed. Results: Fifteen subjects participated. The average brow position ratio was 1.00 ± 0.08 for the visual deprivation group, which was not different from baseline (p = 0.86). The average brow position ratio for the external eyelid weight group was 1.13 ± 0.07, which was statistically significant compared with baseline and the visual deprivation group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Inducing visual deprivation with a black contact lens does not lead to a change in brow position. However, placing an external eyelid weight does lead brow elevation, with an average increase of 13% from baseline. This suggests a likely role for proprioceptive or sensory inputs in frontalis muscle contraction in the setting of eyelid ptosis. © 2018 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.

Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that the higher frequency of visual words in a large variety of English corpora is reflected in greater lexical differentiation—a greater number of unique words—for the visual domain in the English lexicon. In comparison, sensory modalities that are less frequently talked about, particularly taste and smell, show less lexical differentiation. In addition, we show that even though sensory language can be expected to change across historical time and between contexts of use (e.g., spoken language versus fiction), the pattern of visual dominance is a stable property of the English language. Thus, we show that across the board, precisely those semantic domains that are more frequently talked about are also more lexically differentiated, for perceptual experiences. This correlation between type and token frequencies suggests that the sensory lexicon of English is geared towards communicative efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies explore such processing in mothers of children with ASD, and none has assessed the early processing of infant faces in these women. Moreover, whether processing of infant facial expressions in mothers of children with ASD is related to their response to their child's needs (maternal sensitivity [MS]) remains unknown. This study explored the N170 related to infant faces in a group of mothers of children with ASD (MA) and a reference group of mothers of children without ASD. For both emotional (crying, smiling) and neutral expressions, the MA group exhibited larger amplitudes of N170 in the right hemisphere, while the reference group showed similar interhemispheric amplitudes. This lateralization effect within the MA group was not present for nonfaces and was stronger in the mothers with higher MS. We propose that mothers of ASD children use specialized perceptual resources to process infant faces, and this specialization is mediated by MS. Our findings suggest that having an ASD child modulates mothers' early neurophysiological responsiveness to infant cues. Whether this modulation represents a biological marker or a response given by experience remains to be explored.

Lay Summary: When mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) see baby faces expressing emotions, they show a right-sided electrical response in the brain. This lateralization was stronger in mothers who were more sensitive to their children's needs. We conclude that having a child with ASD and being more attuned to their behavior generates a specialized pattern of brain activity when processing infant faces.

"Yang X.; Zeng J.; Wang J.; Liu L.";0.0;Temporal frequency discrimination in amblyopia;2018;Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine;10.3892/etm.2018.6688;The present study aimed to explore temporal frequency discrimination in amblyopia, and the influence of attentional load on amblyopic temporal cognition. Twenty anisometropic amblyopes, 20 strabismic amblyopes and 20 normal subjects were recruited. A flickering disk was used for visual stimuli. A two-alternative, forced-choice staircase paradigm was used to measure the temporal frequency discrimination thresholds of amblyopic eyes, fellow eyes and normal dominant eyes under reference temporal frequencies of 5, 10 and 20 Hz. The just-noticeable differences data were analyzed statistically. In addition, the temporal frequency discrimination thresholds of the subjects were measured under different conditions of attentional load. The changes in temporal frequency discrimination thresholds were compared between amblyopic and normal eyes when attention was loaded. At the reference temporal frequencies of 5 and 10 Hz, temporal thresholds of amblyopic eyes were significantly increased compared with fellow eyes (P<0.05). Regarding strabismic amblyopia, temporal thresholds of fellow eyes were increased compared with normal eyes (P<0.05). However, no correlation was identified between the temporal-frequency discrimination thresholds and the LogMAR visual acuities in amblyopic eyes. In addition, higher attentional load caused greater changes in temporal thresholds in amblyopic eyes, but the situation was not the same for lower attentional load. In conclusion, in the present study a deficit of temporal frequency discrimination in amblyopic eyes and the fellow eyes of strabismic amblyopes was identified. Furthermore, the influence of attentional load on temporal frequency discrimination in amblyopic eyes was increased compared with normal eyes. © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.

Several psychophysical tests were recently proposed to quantify the magnitude of dominance but whether their results agree was never investigated. We addressed this question for the two most common psychophysical tests: The perceived-phase test, which measures the cyclopean appearance of dichoptically presented sinusoids of different phase, and the coherence-threshold test, which measures interocular differences in motion perception when signal and noise stimuli are presented dichoptically. We also checked for agreement with three classical tests (Worth 4-dot, Randot suppression, and Bagolini lenses). Psychophysical tests were administered in their conventional form and also using more dependable psychophysical methods. The results showed weak correlations between psychophysical measures of strength of dominance with inconsistent identification of the dominant eye across tests: Agreement on left-eye dominance, right-eye dominance, or nondominance by both tests occurred only for 11 of 40 observers (27.5%); the remaining 29 observers were classified differently by each test, including 14 cases (35%) of opposite classification (left-eye dominance by one test and right-eye dominance by the other). Classical tests also yielded conflicting results that did not agree well with classification based on psychophysical tests. The results are discussed in the context of determination of ocular dominance for clinical decisions. © The Author(s) 2019."

Thirty-five eyes of 35 healthy young participants underwent standard automated perimetry (Humphrey 24–2 SITA-Standard) in dominant eye fixation, non-dominant eye fixation, and binocular fixation conditions. Fixation variability during foveal threshold and visual field measurement, which was recorded using a wearable eye-tracking glass and calculated using the bivariate contour ellipse area (deg2), was compared among the three fixation conditions. Further, the association of bivariate contour ellipse area with ocular position and fusional amplitude during binocular fixation was analysed. There were no significant differences in bivariate contour ellipse area during foveal threshold measurement among the dominant eye fixation (1.75 deg2), non-dominant eye fixation (1.45 deg2), and binocular fixation (1.62 deg2) conditions. In contrast, the bivariate contour ellipse area during visual field measurement in binocular fixation (2.85 deg2) was significantly lower than the bivariate contour ellipse area in dominant eye fixation (4.62 deg2; p = 0.0227) and non-dominant eye fixation (5.24 deg2; p = 0.0006) conditions. There was no significant difference in bivariate contour ellipse area during visual field measurement between dominant eye fixation and non-dominant eye fixation conditions. There was no significant correlation between bivariate contour ellipse area and either ocular position or fusional amplitude during both foveal threshold and visual field measurements. Thus, fixation variability might be improved in binocular fixation conditions during a long-duration test, such as visual field measurement. © 2018 Hirasawa et al.

We conducted this study to determine the effect of head tilt on image orientation measured by the fovea-Bruch's membrane opening (FoBMO) angle with optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Methods: The study included 56 healthy subjects with mean (range) age of 33 (18 to 61) years. The dominant eye was first determined. To measure head tilt, a smartphone with a built-in gyroscope was affixed to the subject's head with adjustable straps. OCT imaging was performed in both eyes (in randomized order) at 0, 5, and 10 degrees of head tilt in the direction of the imaged eye (ipsilateral head tilt), and then in the opposite direction (contralateral head tilt). For each image, the device software determined Bruch's membrane opening center and the foveal pit from which the FoBMO angle was derived. Results: Thirty-eight (68%) subjects were right eye dominant and 18 (32%) were left eye dominant. Each 1 degree head tilt resulted in a mean change of 0.76 degree in the FoBMO angle (P<0.01), with no significant difference in effect between the 2 eyes (P=0.72). The magnitude of the effect increased from 5 to 10 degrees, and was similar for both ipsilateral and contralateral head tilt. Ocular dominance did not modulate the effect of head tilt (P=0.42). Conclusions: Head tilt significantly affects OCT image orientation as measured by the FoBMO angle, presumably because cyclotorsion is not fully compensatory. The magnitude and direction of the effect does not depend on the dominant eye. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.
"Han C.; He Z.J.; Ooi T.L.";0.0;Effect of Interocular Contrast Difference on Stereopsis in Observers With Sensory Eye Dominance;2019;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;10.1167/iovs.18-26112;PURPOSE. We investigated how sensory eye dominance (SED) affects stereopsis when the halfimages of random-dot-stereo stimuli had different interocular contrast. METHODS. We measured crossed and uncrossed stereo disparity thresholds and reaction time to seeing random-dot-stereograms with variable interocular contrast differences (ICD), where ICD (log10 [CLE] log10 [CRE])0.4,0.2, 0, 0.2, or 0.4 log unit. The mean contrast of the stimuli, (log10 [CLE] þ log10 [CRE])/2, remained constant at 1.2 log unit to ensure that the measured effect was solely due to ICD. We also measured SED using, respectively, dichoptic horizontal sine wave gratings with different phases (revealing SEDcombo) and dichoptic vertical and horizontal gratings (revealing SEDinhibition). RESULTS. Both measures of SEDinhibition and SEDcombo revealed the observers had the same eye as dominant although the magnitudes differed. The observers had lower stereo thresholds and shorter stereo reaction time on stimuli with unequal interocular contrast when the non– sensory-dominant eye viewed the higher contrast half-image, suggesting a stimuluscompensating effect. We then estimated the ICD of random-dot-stereo half-images (compensating stimuli) that would lead to minimum stereo threshold (SEDstereo-threshold) and reaction time (SEDstereo-RT) based on the stereo performance and ICD relationship, and found that they were significantly smaller than SEDinhibition and SEDcombo. CONCLUSIONS. By linking SEDinhibition and SEDcombo with the effect of ICD on stereopsis, we provided further support for the notion that the stimulus-compensating effect is mediated by the interocular inhibitory and interocular gain control mechanisms. Furthermore, the interocular contrast for SEDstereo-threshold and SEDstereo-RT can be potentially applied for improving stereopsis in individuals with SED. © 2019 The Authors. All rights reserved.

To improve these results, we propose a treatment in the form of a video game, using random-dot stimuli and perceptual learning techniques to stimulate stereoacuity. The protocol is defined for stereo-deficient patients between 7-14 years of age who have already received treatment for amblyopia and have a monocular best corrected distance visual acuity of at least 0.1 logMAR. Patients are required to complete a perceptual learning program at home using the video game. While compliance is stored automatically in the cloud, periodic optometry center visits are used to track patient evolution and adjust the game's stereoscopic demand until the smallest detectable disparity is achieved. The protocol has proved to be successful, and effectiveness is gauged in terms of a two-level gain on a random stereoacuity test (global stereoacuity or cyclopean stereoacuity reference test). Moreover, the random-dot stimuli learning transfers to medial lateral stereoscopic acuity according to a Wirt Circles test, in which success criteria is a final stereoacuity of over 140"", and the attained enhancement corresponds to no less than two levels of stereoscopic acuity. Six months later, a random-dot stereoacuity test recorded no reduction in the stereoacuity that was achieved. © 2020 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License."

These diseases, i.e., glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration, require life-long treatment and cause irreversible blindness. Conversely, early diagnosis has been shown to curtail or prevent blindness and visual impairments. A critical element of the clinical diagnosis is the analysis of individual retinal layer properties, as the manifestation of the dominant eye diseases has been shown to correlate with structural changes to the retinal layers. Regrettably, manual segmentation is dependent on the ophthalmologist's level of expertise, and currently becoming impractical due to advancement in imaging modalities. Inherently, much research on computer-aided diagnostic methods is conducted to aid in extracting useful layer information from these images, which were inaccessible without these techniques. However, speckle noise and intensity inhomogeneity remain a challenge with a detrimental effect on the performance of automated methods. In this paper, we propose a method comprising of fuzzy image processing techniques and graph-cut methods to robustly segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) into five (5) distinct layers. Notably, the method establishes a specific region of interest to suppress the interference of speckle noise, while Fuzzy C-means is utilized to build data terms for better integration into the continuous max-flow to handle inhomogeneity. The method is evaluated on 225 OCT B-scan images, and promising experimental results were achieved. The method will allow for early diagnosis of major eye diseases by providing the basic, yet critical layer information necessary for an effective eye examination. © 2013 IEEE.

This study aims 1) to investigate the effect of age and gender effect in vividness and timing capabilities on MI, and 2) to examine the relationship between these two dimensions of MI. Methods: A population of 72 (47% of males) good imagers including 41 young subjects and 31 older subjects were assessed on MI vividness using the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire (VMIQ-2) and on MI timing using the performances of the real Timed Up and Go (rTUG) test and its imagined version (iTUG). The main outcome variables were the VMIQ-2 score and the delta-TUG, i.e. the difference between rTUG and iTUG. Results: Mental vividness was affected by ageing with a loss of visual dominance in favor of kinesthetic imagery in older subjects compared to younger ones; however, no difference between both groups was found in timing measured by delta-TUG. Vividness capabilities were similar between men and women, but women performed better in timing. VMIQ-2 scores were not associated with delta-TUG; only gender was significantly associated with delta-TUG. Conclusions: This study revealed 1) an age-related transfer from a visual to a kinesthetic MI ability, but no impact on timing of MI; 2) a gender effect on timing with no impact on mental vividness; 3) no association between vividness and timing capabilities. © 2018"

Due to a central cognitive bottleneck, responses to the second stimulus are delayed, especially at short stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) between the two stimuli. Although the mechanisms of dual-task interference in the classical PRP paradigm have been extensively investigated, specific mechanisms underlying the cross-modal PRP paradigm are not well understood. In particular, it remains unknown whether the dominance of vision over audition manifests in the cross-modal PRP tasks. The present study aimed to investigate whether the visual dominance effect manifests in the cross-modal PRP paradigm. Methods: We adapted the classical PRP paradigm by manipulating the order of a visual and an auditory task: the visual task could either precede the auditory task or vice versa, at either short or long SOAs. Twenty-five healthy participants took part in Experiment 1, and thirty-three new participants took part in Experiment 2. Reaction time and accuracy data were calculated and further analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: The results showed that visual precedence in the Visual-Auditory condition caused larger impairments to the subsequent auditory processing than vice versa in the Auditory-Visual condition: a larger delay of second response was revealed in the Visual-Auditory condition (135 ± 10 ms) than the Auditory-Visual condition (88 ± 9 ms). This effect was found only at the short SOAs under the existence of the central bottleneck, but not at the long SOAs. Moreover, this effect occurred both when the single visual and the single auditory task were of equal difficulty in Experiment 1 and when the single auditory task was more difficult than the single visual task in Experiment 2. Conclusion: Results of the two experiments suggested that the visual dominance effect occurred under the central bottleneck of cognitive processing. © 2018 Chinese Medical Journal / Produced by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

Thus far, this method has only been used for suppressing two-dimensional images presented on screen. We present a novel variant of CFS, termed “real-life” CFS, in which a portion of the actual immediate surroundings of an observer—including three-dimensional, real-life objects—can be rendered unconscious. Our method uses augmented reality goggles to present subjects with CFS masks to the dominant eye, leaving the nondominant eye exposed to the real world. In three experiments we demonstrated that real objects can indeed be suppressed from awareness for several seconds, on average, and that the suppression duration is comparable to that obtained using classic, on-screen CFS. As supplementary information, we further provide an example of experimental code that can be modified for future studies. This technique opens the way to new questions in the study of consciousness and its functions. © 2018, The Author(s).

TEAD transcriptional activity is regulated via interactions with the YAP, TAZ and VGLL proteins. A mutation in the TEAD1 gene, Tyr421His, has been identified in patients suffering from Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy (SCA), an autosomal dominant eye disease. This mutation prevents the YAP/TAZ:TEAD1 interaction. In this study, we measure the affinity of YAP, TAZ and VGLL1 for the four human TEADs and find that they have a similar affinity for all TEADs. We quantitate the effect of the mutation found in SCA patients and show that it destabilizes the YAP/TAZ:TEAD interaction by about 3 kcal·mol−1. We determine the structure of YAP in complex with this mutant form of TEAD and show that the histidine residue adopts different conformations at the binding interface. The presence of this flexible residue induces the destabilization of several H-bonds and the loss of van der Waals contacts, which explains why the Tyr421HisTEAD1 mutation has such a large destabilizing effect on the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex.

METHODS: A total of 10 patients participated in the study. The anisocoria generated by corneal inlays was simulated by using a small-aperture contact lens fitted on the non-dominant eye. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity function, visual discrimination capacity (halo perception), and stereoacuity tests were performed under natural conditions or when the non-dominant eye wore the small-aperture contact lens under two conditions: induced anisocoria and induced anisocoria combined with monovision (using two add-powers: +0.75 and +1.25 diopters [D]). Stereoscopic vision and binocular summation were analyzed under those experimental conditions and for far, intermediate, and near vision. RESULTS: The results showed a deterioration in stereoacuity with respect to natural conditions, being significant mainly for near and intermediate distances. Results with other visual functions showed a deterioration of the binocular summation and therefore of visual performance, although not in a generalized way for all distances. Binocular visual acuity under the conditions that used the small-aperture contact lens was comparable to that of the natural eye. CONCLUSIONS: The deterioration of stereopsis and other binocular functions found in this study may be acceptable for patients who had this surgical technique because it is similar to the deterioration found in other surgical procedures of emmetropization.

Methods: A prospective study of 19 attended patients who were subject to treatment with Levodopa and Carbidopa on doses of 0.7mg/kg/day, a ratio of 4:1 divided into three daily doses for 5 weeks, combined with full occlusion (24 hours/day) of the dominant eye. The ophthalmologic exam from previous consultations up to treatment and after 8 weeks of therapy were collected from medical record data. Patients who had completed treatment for more than 12 months were included for complete eye examination. Results: The mean age before treatment with levodopa was 11.0 ± 4.2 years old (varying from 7 to 23 years). The best-corrected visual acuity (Snellen chart) of the amblyopic eye before treatment was 0.24 (0.6 in logMAR) ± 0.16, after 8 weeks of treatment it was 0.47(0.3 in logMAR) ± 0.33, while during the final evaluation it was 0.46 (0.3 in logMAR) ± 0.34. There was a statistically significant improvement in vision after 8 weeks of therapy which was maintained until the final evaluation (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Levodopa/Carbidopa therapyat doses of 0.7 mg/kg/day at a ratio of 4:1 divided in three daily doses, associated with full occlusion of the dominant eye during 5 weeks had a significant improvement on the visual acuity of the amblyopic eye, and persisted up to 1 year after the treatment. © 2019,Revista Brasileira de Oftalmologia.

In this study eye movements (EM) were recorded in fifteen presbyopic participants, naïve to monovision, whilst they read arrays of words, non-words, and text passages to assess whether monovision affected their reading. Three conditions were compared, using daily disposable CLs: baseline (near correction in both eyes), conventional monovision (distance correction in the dominant eye, near correction in the non-dominant eye), and crossed monovision (the reversal of conventional monovision). Behavioral measures (reading speed and accuracy) and EM parameters (single fixation duration, number of fixations, dwell time per item, percentage of regressions, and percentage of skipped items) were analyzed. When reading passages, no differences in behavioral and EM measures were seen in any comparison of the three conditions. The number of fixations and dwell time significantly increased for both monovision and crossed monovision with respect to baseline only with word and non-word arrays. It appears that monovision did not appreciably alter visual processing when reading meaningful texts but some limited stress of the EM pattern was observed only with arrays of unrelated or meaningless items under monovision, which require the reader to have more in-depth controlled visual processing. © 2018, The Author(s).

In Viewport Dependent Streaming (VDS) only the current user viewport is streamed at high quality, while the remaining parts are streamed at lower quality. This technology may save streaming bandwidth considerably, especially when it is associated to other techniques. Among the others, asymmetric stereoscopic video, has been studied in the past for traditional video and displays. We focused our research on the usage of asymmetric stereoscopic video for omnidirectional streams watched with a Head Mounted Display (HMD) in VDS. We conducted two subjective quality experiments with the main goal of reducing the streaming bandwidth, while keeping the subjective video quality at the highest level. We assessed asymmetric video applied separately to the foreground and background views of omnidirectional VDS sessions. We show that for VDS, applying asymmetric stereoscopic streaming delivery on the foreground view can save up to 41% bit rate, and using the same technique on the background view can save approximately up to 15% bit rate. Furthermore, eye dominance was seen not to be relevant in our experiments. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Track-weighted imaging (TWI) was recently introduced as a qualitative tractography-based method with high anatomical contrast. Purpose: To explore the human retina in healthy volunteers and patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) using TWI reconstructions. Study Type: Prospective. Population: Twenty AION patients compared with 20 healthy volunteers. Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0T MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with b-value of 1000 s/mm2 and 60 diffusion-weighting noncollinear directions. Assessment: We performed constrained spherical deconvolution from the diffusion-weighted signal and volumetric tractography method, whereby 10 million streamlines are initiated from seed points randomly distributed throughout the orbital area. We then reconstructed TWI maps with isotropic voxel size of 300 μm. Statistical Tests: We tested the effect of the number of diffusion-weighting directions, ocular laterality, and ocular dominance on healthy retinal fascicles distribution. We then performed factorial analysis of variance to test the effects of the presence/absence of the fascicles on the visual field defect in patients. Results: In healthy volunteers, we found more temporal fascicle in right eyes (P = 0.001), more superior fascicles in dominant eyes (P = 0.014), and fewer fascicles with tractography maps based on 30 directions than those based on 45 directions (P = 9 × 10−8) and 60 directions (P = 6 × 10−7). Eight out of 20 AION patients presented with complete absence of neuroretinal fascicle, side of the disease, which was correlated with visual field mean deviation at the 6-month visit [F(1,17) = 6.97, P = 0.016]. Seven patients presented with a temporal fascicle in the injured eye; this fascicle presence was linked to visual field mean deviation at the 6-month visit [F(1,17) = 8.43, P = 0.009]. Data Conclusion: In AION patients, the presence of the temporal neuroretinal fascicle in the affected eye provides an objective outcome radiological sign correlated with visual performance.

The paired eyes were divided into worse and better eyes according to the mean deviation (MD) of visual field (VF) results. Based on the results, patients whose sighting eyes corresponded to eyes with a better VF were designated as group 1, and those whose sighting eyes corresponded to eyes with a worse VF as group 2. RESULTS. The sighting eye corresponded predominantly to eyes with better VFs (P < 0.001). The MD of the worse eye was significantly lower (P = 0.008), and the intereye difference in MD was significantly larger in group 1 than in group 2 (P < 0.001). In a comparison of regional VF threshold values and corresponding retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), the superior and inferior VF threshold values were consistently more deteriorated in the nonsighting worse eyes in group 1 (P = 0.009 and 0.003), compared with the sighting worse eyes in group 2, whereas the corresponding RNFLT was not significantly different between the groups. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the sighting eye choice (P = 0.047), higher vertical cup-to disc ratio (P = 0.042), older age (P = 0.044), thinner average RNFLT (P = 0.007), and average ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness of worse eyes (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with the MD of the worse eyes. CONCLUSIONS. The sighting eye choice was associated with functional asymmetry between eyes with glaucoma. The functional deterioration was evident in nonsighting eyes with worse VFs. © 2018 The Authors.

Recent research has found evidence of a bias towards one image at the initial ‘onset’ period of rivalry that varies across the peripheral visual field. To determine the role that visual field location plays in and around the fovea at onset, trained observers were presented small orthogonal achromatic grating patches at various locations across the central 3◦ of visual space for 1-s and 60-s intervals. Results reveal stronger bias at onset than during continuous rivalry, and evidence of temporal hemifield dominance across observers, however, the nature of the hemifield effects differed between individuals and interacted with overall eye dominance. Despite using small grating patches, a high proportion of mixed percept was still reported, with more mixed percept at onset along the vertical midline, in general, and in increasing proportions with eccentricity in the lateral hemifields. Results show that even within the foveal range, onset rivalry bias varies across visual space, and differs in degree and sensitivity to biases in average dominance over continuous viewing. © MDPI AG.

Such failure of auditory attention is thought to rely on top-down biasing mechanisms at the central executive level. A complementary approach to account for this phenomenon is to consider the existence of visual dominance over hearing that could be implemented via direct visual-to-auditory pathways. To investigate this phenomenon, thirteen aircraft pilots, equipped with a 32-channel EEG system, faced a low and high workload scenarii along with an auditory oddball task in a motion flight simulator. Prior to the flying task, the pilots were screened to assess their working memory span and visual dominance susceptibility. The behavioral results disclosed that the volunteers missed 57.7% of the auditory alarms in the difficult condition. Among all evaluated capabilities, only the visual dominance index was predictive of the miss rate in the difficult scenario. These findings provide behavioral evidences that other early cross-modal competitive process than top down modulation process could account for inattentional deafness. The electrophysiological analyses showed that the miss over the hit alarms led to a significant amplitude reduction of early perceptual (N100) and late attentional (P3a and P3b) event-related potentials components. Eventually, we implemented an EEG-based processing pipeline to perform single-trial classification of inattentional deafness. The results indicate that this processing chain could be used in an ecological setting as it led to 72.2% mean accuracy to discriminate missed from hit auditory alarms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: Thirty-eight eyes of 19 patients consecutively treated with central PresbyLASIK were assessed. The mean age of the patients was 51 ± 3 years at the time of treatment with a mean spherical equivalent refraction of -0.57 ± 1.98 diopters (D) and mean astigmatism of 0.58 ± 0.57 D. Monocular corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), corrected near visual acuity (CNVA), and distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UIVA), distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA), and uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively for the dominant eye, non-dominant eye, and binocularly. Subjective quality of vision and near vision were assessed using the 10-item, Rasch-scaled, Quality of Vision (QoV) Questionnaire and Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ), respectively. RESULTS: At 6 years postoperatively, mean binocular UDVA was 20/18 ± 4 and mean binocular UNVA and UIVA were 0.11 ± 0.13 and -0.08 ± 0.08 logRAD, respectively. Spherical equivalent showed a slow hyperopic drift of +0.10 D per year with refractive astigmatism stable from 6 weeks postoperatively. Defocus curves showed an improvement of 0.4 Snellen lines at best focus from 1 to 6 years of follow-up, reaching preoperative levels. Compared to the preoperative status, the corneal and ocular spherical aberrations (at a 6-mm diameter) decreased and were stable from 3 months of follow-up. Questionnaires revealed a postoperative unaided QoV score comparable to preoperative scores and with an improved postoperative unaided NAVQ score compared to preoperative scores with best correction. CONCLUSIONS: Presbyopic treatment using a hybrid bi-aspheric micro-monovision ablation profile is safe and efficacious even after 6 years postoperatively. The postoperative outcomes indicate improvements in binocular vision at far, intermediate, and near distances. An 8% re-treatment rate should be considered to increase satisfaction levels, including a 3% reversal rate. © 2020 Slack Incorporated. All rights reserved.

Yet, little is known about how monocular visual cues may modulate the vestibular control of standing balance. Research question: To determine how visual cues, specifically monocular vision, modulate the vestibular-evoked myogenic and whole-body balance response. Methods: Seventeen (12 female) healthy subjects (age: 24.8 ± 5.3years) were exposed to a random, continuous electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS) signal (±3.5 mA, 0–20 Hz). Subjects stood quietly during four experimental (no vision, non-dominant eye, dominant eye, binocular) conditions. The EVS-medial-lateral ground reaction force (ML GRF) acting on the body and EVS-medial gastrocnemius electromyography (EMG, bilateral) responses were evaluated in the frequency (coherence) and time (cumulant density) domains. Results: Coherence was increased for no vision compared to binocular, dominant eye, and non-dominant eye visual cues, respectively, with the most pronounced increases occurring at lower frequencies. For cumulant density, the EVS-ML GRF medium-latency peak amplitude was increased 45, 26 and 18% with no vision compared to binocular, dominant eye and non-dominant eye visual cues, respectively (p <.05). The EVS-EMG medium-latency peak amplitude during no vision was greater than binocular (p <.05) for both gastrocnemii, but binocular and dominant eye monocular vision was not different (p >.05). The EVS-ML GRF and EVS-EMG (right medial gastrocnemius) medium-latency peak amplitude was greater for non-dominant eye monocular vision compared to binocular vision (p <.05). Significance: Monocular visual cues, at least for the dominant eye, can depress the vestibular-evoked balance response at low frequencies akin to binocular vision with limited differences exhibited between dominant and non-dominant eye. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: All RRD cases in Pontevedra from 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Climatological data from 4 weather stations in the area were collected. The association between RRD incidence and solar radiation was investigated. Results: A total of 256 RRD cases were identified. There was a seasonal variation in the incidence of RRD with a maximum number of incident cases observed in June and July and a minimum number of cases observed in January and December. An association was found between RRD incidence and solar radiation both monthly (p = 0.004) and bimonthly (p = 0.057). The right eye was more frequently affected than the left eye (p = 0.035). RD cases other than rhegmatogenous showed neither seasonality nor association with radiation. Conclusions: Solar radiation may play a role in RRD genesis in our area. Laterality could be related to the amount of radiation reaching each eye. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.

Given the link between stereopsis and postural stability, it is important that we have full understanding of the impact of monovision on binocular function. In this study we assessed the short-term effects of optically induced monovision on a depth-discrimination task for young and older (presbyopic) adults. In separate sessions, the upper limits of stereopsis were assessed with participants' best optical correction and with monovision (-1D and +1D lenses in front of the dominant and non-dominant eyes respectively), at both near (62 cm) and far (300 cm) viewing distances. Monovision viewing resulted in significant reductions in the upper limit of stereopsis or more generally in discrimination performance at large disparities, in both age groups at a viewing distance of 300 cm. Dynamic photorefraction performed on a sample of four young observers revealed that they tended to accommodate to minimize blur in one eye at the expense of blur in the other. Older participants would have experienced roughly equivalent blur in the two eyes. Despite this difference, both groups displayed similar detrimental effects of monovision. In addition, we find that discrimination accuracy was worse with monovision at the 3 m viewing distance which involves fixation distances that are typical during walking. These data suggest that stability during locomotion may be compromised, a factor that is of concern for our older participants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Setting: Chongqing Aier Mega Eye Hospital, Chongqing, China; Daping Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, China. Design: Prospective study. Methods: The study comprised 70 cataract patients who had bilateral implantation of TECNIS Symfony extended range of vision IOLs, either with intended micro-monovision (monovision group: 35 patients) or with intended emmetropia (control group: 35 patients). Visual acuity, modulation transfer function (MTF), defocus curve, spectacle independence, and photic phenomena were analyzed 3 months postoperatively. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in binocular uncorrected visual acuity at distance. Mean binocular uncorrected visual acuity at intermediate (monovision: 0.81 dec; control: 0.58 dec) and near (monovision: 0.59 dec; control: 0.30 dec) were significantly better in the monovision group. In the monovision group, the difference of MTF values between the dominant and the non-dominant eyes was not statistically significant and MTF values were within the normal range for both eyes. Spectacle independence at intermediate and near was statistically significantly higher in the monovision group compared to the control group. The incidence of photic phenomena was similar in both groups. Conclusion: Micro-monovision implantation of TECNIS Symfony IOLs provided a superior range of visual acuity from far to near and higher spectacle independence compared to a control group targeted for emmetropia. © 2019 Tan et al."

Methods This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 44 healthy Japanese subjects who were experiencing eye fatigue caused by VDT work. The subjects were randomly assigned to either supplement with bilberry extract (BB group, n=22) or placebo (P group, n=22) group using a computerized random number generator, and each subject took one capsule per day for 12 weeks. Assessments of accommodative function and night vision and questionnaires were completed before intake and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after intake. Safety evaluation was performed via ophthalmic examination. Somatometric parameters, physical examination, urinalysis, and blood tests were conducted before intake only. Results The final analysis included 17 subjects in the BB group and 18 subjects in the P group. The BB group had significantly higher pupillary constriction ratios, which were adjusted by calculating load in the dominant eye and both eyes, compared with the P group (P=0.039 and P=0.026, respectively). No safety concerns were noted. Conclusions The consumption of a supplement containing bilberry extract for 12 weeks improved accommodative function, eye fatigue, and subjective eye-related symptoms. In the BB group, the decline in accommodative function caused by VDT work improved over the 12 weeks, subjective symptoms were alleviated, and eye fatigue was temporarily reduced. © 2019 Life Science Publishing Co.

The proposed algorithm first uses the gradient magnitude response images (GMRIs) of the left and right views to model stimulus strength, and synthesizes two fusion images (FIs) by taking the left and the right views as dominant eye input, respectively, according to the theory of ocular dominance in human visual system. Then, the global histogram representations of the rotation invariant uniform local binary patterns, the Pearson linear correlation coefficient, and the asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution model are employed to extract various perceptual features from the two GMRIs and the two FIs. Finally, with a pre-trained AdaBoosting support vector regression model, the extracted quality-aware feature vector of the stereoscopic image is mapped into the image quality score. Experimental results on four benchmark stereoscopic image databases show that, compared with the state-of-the-art SIQA algorithms, the prediction accuracy on asymmetrically distorted images of the proposed algorithm is greatly improved, and the implementation efficiency of the proposed algorithm is high. The results indicate that the extracted features of the proposed algorithm are more descriptive, and the quality mapping model is more stable. Copyright © 2019 Acta Automatica Sinica.

Augmented reality devices allow users to see virtual information superimposed on the environment. The particularity of monocular systems is that they do not stimulate the eyes in the same way and can therefore induce binocular rivalry. This occurs when the brain is unable to merge the different images presented to each eye and perception alternates between them. It can cause visual fatigue, headache and visual suppression. Binocular rivalry can be characterized in terms of alternation rate, predominance (i.e. total proportion of the binocular rivalry viewing time that a stimulus is dominant) and average dominance duration (for all individual dominance periods). The literature suggests that these variables depend on the conditions of use and the visual stimuli available to the subject. Notably, several parameters have an impact, including contrast, spatial frequency, brightness, etc. The impact of other parameters, such as ocular dominance, remains the subject of debate. With respect to the latter, the literature describes various definitions and tests, and it appears that there are three main forms: motor, acuity and sensorial, the latter being of interest for binocular rivalry. © 2019 SPIE.
"Schloss K.B.; Palmer S.E.";0.0;An ecological framework for temporal and individual differences in color preferences;2017;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2017.01.010;"There are well-known and extensive differences in color preferences between individuals, but there are also within-individual differences from one time to another. Despite the seeming independence between these individual and temporal effects, we propose that they have the same underlying cause: people's ecological experiences with color-associated objects and events. Our approach is motivated by the Ecological Valence Theory (EVT; Palmer & Schloss, 2010) which states that preference for a given color is determined by the combined valence (liking/disliking) of all objects and events associated with that color. We define three ecologically-based hypotheses for explaining temporal and individual differences in color preferences concerning: (1) differences in object valences, (2) differences in color-object associations, and (3) differences in object activations in the mind when preferences are measured. We review prior studies that support these hypotheses and raise open research questions about untested predictions. We also extend the computational framework of the EVT by defining a single weighted average equation that captures both individual and temporal differences in color preferences. Finally, we consider other factors that potentially contribute to color preferences, including abstract symbolic associations, color in design, and psychophysical and/or physiological factors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

This is called ocular dominance. Extremely imbalanced ocular dominance can be found among certain patient groups, for example, in patients with amblyopia. Here, we introduce a novel method to rebalance ocular dominance. We developed an altered-reality system that subjects used to interact with the natural world, the appearance of which was changed through a real-time image process. Several daily adaptation sessions lasting 3 hr each reduced sensory ocular dominance in adults who were not diagnosed with amblyopia and improved vision in patients with amblyopia. Surprising additional strengthening was found over the subsequent 2 months, when subjects experienced natural vision only. Our method effectively trains subjects to use both eyes in the wide variety of everyday tasks. The transfer of this training to everyday vision likely produced the continuing growth in effects during the months after the training. These findings are promising for the application of this method in future clinical research on amblyopia. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.
"Spiegel D.P.; Baldwin A.S.; Hess R.F.";0.0;Ocular dominance plasticity: Inhibitory interactions and contrast equivalence;2017;Scientific Reports;10.1038/srep39913;Brief monocular occlusion results in a transient change in ocular dominance, such that the previously patched eye makes a stronger contribution to the binocular percept after occlusion. The previously unpatched eye therefore makes a correspondingly weaker contribution to the binocular sum. To shed light on the mechanism underlying this change we investigate how the relationship between the perception of fusion, suppression, and diplopia changes after short-term monocular deprivation. Results show that fusible stimuli seen by the unpatched eye are actively suppressed as a result of patching and that this can be reversed by an interocular contrast imbalance. This suggests that dichoptic inhibition plays an important role in ocular dominance changes due to short-term occlusion, possibly by altering the contrast gain prior to binocular summation. This may help explain why this form of plasticity affects the perception of both fusible and rivalrous stimuli. © The Author(s) 2017.

However, the existence of a clear anatomical asymmetry providing an initial imbalance for normal neural development is still not understood. Using a so-called foveascope, we found that for a cohort of 30 normal adults, the two blue cone-free areas at the centre of the foveas are asymmetrical. The noise-stimulated afterimage dominant eye introduced here corresponds to the circular blue cone-free area, while the non-dominant eye corresponds to the diffuse and irregular elliptical outline. By contrast, we found that this asymmetry is absent or frustrated in a similar cohort of 30 adults with normal ocular status, but with dyslexia, i.e. with visual and phonological deficits. In this case, our results show that the two Maxwell centroid outlines are both circular but lead to an undetermined afterimage dominance with a coexistence of primary and mirror images. The interplay between the lack of asymmetry and the development in the neural maturation of the brain pathways suggests new implications in both fundamental and biomedical sciences. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the usefulness of Lasso regression to predict VF progression in the central 10 degrees (10-2) in glaucoma patients. Methods: Series of 10 VFs (Humphrey Field Analyzer 10-2 SITA-standard) from each of 149 eyes in 110 open angle glaucoma patients, obtained over 5.7±1.4 years (mean±SD) were investigated. Mean deviation values of the 10th VF were predicted using varying numbers of VFs (ranging from the first to third VFs to the first to ninth VFs), applying ordinary least square regression (OLSLR) and Lasso regression. Absolute prediction errors were then compared. Results: With OLSLR, prediction error varied between 5.4±5.0 (using first to third VFs) and 1.1±1.6 dB (using first to ninth VFs). Significantly smaller prediction errors were obtained with Lasso regression, in particular with small numbers of VFs (from 2.1±2.8: first to third VFs, to 1.0±1.6 dB: first to ninth VFs). A large λ value, which is an index showing the degree of penalty in Lasso regression, was observed when a small number of VFs were used for prediction. Conclusion: Mean deviation prediction using OLSLR with a small number of VFs resulted in large prediction errors. It was useful to apply Lasso regression when predicting future progression of the central 10 degrees, compared to OLSLR. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, Kitasato University Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan. Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: This study comprised 12 eyes in 12 patients (age 66.2 ± 5.6 years) who underwent photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) enhancement to improve their dissatisfaction after pseudophakic monovision. We quantitatively assessed the visual and refractive outcomes and the subjective satisfaction measured using a visual analog scale, that ranged from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied), before and 3 months after PRK enhancement. Results: Six (50%) of the 12 patients were dissatisfied with their various distance visions because of a large amount of anisometropia (≥2.50 D). Two (16.7%) were dissatisfied with their distance vision after conventional monovision because of residual cylindrical errors (≥0.75 D) in the dominant eye. Three (25%) was an unknown origin. The remaining one of the 12 patients was dissatisfied due to the unadaptability to crossed monovision. Eleven (91.7%) eyes were within ±0.5 D of the targeted correction after PRK enhancement. The overall satisfaction score was significantly improved, from 3.7 ± 2.4 (range 0–7) preoperatively to 6.0 ± 2.4 (range 2–9) postoperatively (p = 0.02). No vision-threatening complications were seen throughout the observation period. Conclusions: PRK enhancement was effective with predictable refractive results and thus improved patient satisfaction for dissatisfied patients after pseudophakic monovision. These findings also suggest that the accurate correction of refractive errors plays a key role in successful pseudophakic monovision. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Inspired by previous research, the perception and understanding of an image is considered as an active inference process determined by the level of “surprise”, which can be described by EoP. Therefore, the primitives learnt from natural images can be utilized to evaluate the visual information by computing entropy. Meanwhile, considering the binocularity in stereo image quality assessment, a feasible way is proposed to characterize this binocular process according to the sparse representation coefficients of each view. Experimental results on LIVE 3D image databases and MCL database further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high consistency with subjective evaluation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Despite these changes, people with one eye integrate auditory and visual components of multisensory events optimally [3]. The current study investigates how people with one eye perceive the McGurk effect, an audiovisual illusion where a new syllable is perceived when visual lip movements do not match the corresponding sound [4]. We compared individuals with one eye to binocular and monocular viewing controls and found that they have a significantly smaller McGurk effect compared to binocular controls. Additionally, monocular controls tended to perceive the McGurk effect less often than binocular controls suggesting a small transient modulation of the McGurk effect. These results suggest altered weighting of the auditory and visual modalities with both short and long-term monocular viewing. These results indicate the presence of permanent adaptive perceptual accommodations in people who have lost one eye early in life that may serve to mitigate the loss of binocularity during early brain development. © 2018

Therefore, we want to further explore the difference between attractive faces and beautiful objects such as flowers. Methods: We recorded the eye movement of 22 male observers and 23 female observers using a standard two-alternative forced choice. Results: (1) The attractive faces were looked at longer and more often in comparison with the beautiful flowers; (2) fixation counts of female participants are more than male participants; and (3) the participants watched the beautiful flowers first, followed by the attractive faces, but there was no significant difference on the first fixation duration between the beautiful flowers and the attractive faces.

"Jacot-Guillarmod A.; Wang Y.; Pedroza C.; Ogmen H.; Kilpatrick Z.; Josić K.";0.0;Extending Levelt's Propositions to perceptual multistability involving interocular grouping;2017;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2016.12.017;Levelt's Propositions are central to understanding a wide range of multistable perceptual phenomena, but it is unclear whether they extend to perceptual multistability involving interocular grouping. We presented split-grating stimuli with complementary halves of the same color (either red or green) to human subjects. The subjects reported four percepts in alternation: the two stimuli presented to each eye (half red and half green), as well as the two single color (all red or all green), interocularly grouped percepts. Increasing color saturation lead to increased reports of the single color percept in most subjects, indicating increased predominance of grouped percepts (Levelt's Proposition I). This increase in predominance was due to a decrease in the average dominance duration of single-eye percepts, with grouped percept dominance largely unaffected. This agrees with a generalization of Levelt's Proposition II, as the average dominance duration of the stronger (in this case single-eye) percept was primarily affected by changes in stimulus strength. Moreover, in agreement with Levelt's Proposition III the alternation rate between percepts increased as the difference in the strength of the percepts decreased. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

"Ding Y.; Naber M.; Gayet S.; van der Stigchel S.; Paffen C.L.";0.0;Assessing the generalizability of eye dominance across binocular rivalry, onset rivalry, and continuous flash suppression;2018;Journal of Vision;10.1167/18.6.6;It is commonly assumed that one eye is dominant over the other eye. Eye dominance is most frequently determined by using the hole-in-the-card test. However, it is currently unclear whether eye dominance as determined by the hole-in-the-card test (so-called sighting eye dominance) generalizes to tasks involving interocular conflict (engaging sensory eye dominance). We therefore investigated whether sighting eye dominance is linked to sensory eye dominance in several frequently used paradigms that involve interocular conflict. Eye dominance was measured by the hole-inthe- card test, binocular rivalry, and breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS). Relationships between differences in eye dominance were assessed using Bayesian statistics. Strikingly, none of the three interocular conflict tasks yielded a difference in perceptual report between eyes when comparing the dominant eye with the nondominant eye as determined by the hole-in-the-card test. From this, we conclude that sighting eye dominance is different from sensory eye dominance. Interestingly, eye dominance of onset rivalry correlated with that of ongoing rivalry but not with that of b-CFS. Hence, we conclude that b-CFS reflects a different form of eye dominance than onset and ongoing rivalry. In sum, eye dominance seems to be a multifaceted phenomenon, which is differently expressed across interocular conflict paradigms. Finally, we highly discourage using tests measuring sighting eye dominance to determine the dominant eye in a subsequent experiment involving interocular conflict. Rather, we recommend that whenever experimental manipulations require a priori knowledge of eye dominance, eye dominance should be determined using pretrials of the same task that will be used in the main experiment. © 2018 The Authors.

Methods: From October 2011 to August 2012, meibomian gland information was collected in healthy volunteers without any symptoms of ocular discomfort, aged more than 5 years. The people were grouped by every 10 years of age. The meibomian gland opening, secretion state and characteristics and Max's line were observed by slit lamp microscopic examination, and the meibomian gland dropouts were examined by noncontact infrared meibomian gland microscopy. The changes of meibomian glands were scored from 0 to 3, 0 for a normal state, 1 for mild abnormality, 2 for moderate abnormality and 3 for severe abnormality. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the meibomian scores between male and female, and between left and right eyes. The correlation of these scores and the age of volunteers was analyzed by the Spearman test. Results: Among all the 100 volunteers, there were 47 males and 53 females, aged from 5 to 83 years (mean, 40.9±22.9). The meibomian gland dropouts were gradually increasing with age, significantly faster after 40 years old (scores for each age group were 2(1), 2(1), 2(1), 2(1), 3(2), 3.5(1.75), 4(3), 6(2). Meibomian gland opening, secretion traits and secretor status gradually became poorer with age, and changes were dramatically fast in the group of 40-49 years of age [scores of this group were 3(1.5), 3(3) and 2(2)], but slowed down after age of 50 years. Moreover, the Max's line position moved to the front gradually with age, with a marked change in the group of 40-49 years of age [scores for each age group were 0(1), 1(1), 2(2), 2(2), 3(2), 2(2), 3(2)], 4 gland changes showed a significantly positive relation to age(r=0.729, 0.635, 0.669, 0.639, 0.470. P<0.01), but not to gender and eye dominance (P>0.05). Conclusions: Meibomian gland opening and meibomian gland secretion become worse with age. The age of 50 years old is the key period for the meibomian gland changes. Copyright © 2017 by the Chinese Medical Association.

Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 150 older adults with glaucoma, collecting seven visual measures: integrated visual field (VF) sensitivity, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity (CS), area under the log CS function, color vision, stereoacuity, and visual acuity with noise. Principal component analysis was used to examine the dimensionality of vision. Multivariable regression models using one, two, or three vision tests (and nonvisual predictors) were compared to determine which was best associated with Rasch-analyzed Glaucoma Quality of Life-15 (GQL-15) person measure scores. Results: The participants had a mean age of 70.2 and IVF sensitivity of 26.6 dB, suggesting mild-to-moderate glaucoma. All seven vision measures loaded similarly onto the first principal component (eigenvectors, 0.220–0.442), which explained 56.9% of the variance in vision scores. In models for GQL scores, the maximum adjusted-R2 values obtained were 0.263, 0.296, and 0.301 when using one, two, and three vision tests in the models, respectively, though several models in each category had similar adjusted-R2 values. All three of the best-performing models contained CS. Conclusions: Vision in glaucoma is a multidimensional construct that can be described by several variably-correlated vision measures. Measuring more than two vision tests does not substantially improve models for activity limitation. Translational Relevance: A sufficient description of disability in glaucoma can be obtained using one to two vision tests, especially VF and CS. © 2018 The Authors.

Experiment 1 paired music and videos drawn from three levels of valence while holding arousal constant. Experiment 2 included a parallel combination of three levels of arousal while holding valence constant. In each experiment, participants rated their affective states after unimodal and multimodal presentations. Experiment 1 revealed a congruency effect in which stimulus combinations of the same extreme valence resulted in more extreme state ratings than component stimuli presented in isolation. An interaction between music and video valence reflected the greater influence of negative affect. Video valence was found to have a significantly greater effect on combined ratings than music valence. The pattern of data was explained by a five parameter differential weight averaging model that attributed greater weight to the visual modality and increased weight with decreasing values of valence. Experiment 2 revealed a congruency effect only for high arousal combinations and no interaction effects. This pattern was explained by a three parameter constant weight averaging model with greater weight for the auditory modality and a very low arousal value for the initial state. These results demonstrate key differences in audiovisual integration between valence and arousal. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

"Stuit S.; Brascamp J.; Barendregt M.; van der Smagt M.; te Pas S.";0.0;Image-based and eye-based influences on binocular rivalry have similar spatial profiles;2017;Journal of Vision;10.1167/17.12.14;Binocular rivalry occurs when the images presented to the two eyes do not match. Instead of fusing into a stable percept, perception during rivalry alternates between images over time. However, during rivalry, perception can also resemble a patchwork of parts of both eyes' images. Such integration of image parts across eyes is relatively rare compared to integration of image parts presented to the same eye, suggesting that integration across space during rivalry is primarily rooted at the early monocular level of processing. However, recent evidence suggests that rivalry, and potentially also integration across space during rivalry, has its basis at multiple stages of processing, including stages at which monocular signals are minimal. As such, integration and competition at these later stages would be driven more by image-based factors, such as continuity and color than by eye of origin. Because ''higher'' visual areas also have increasingly larger receptive fields, image-based integration may occur over a larger spatial extent compared to monocular, eye-based integration. We therefore used rival images containing two separate image parts and varied the interimage-part distance (IIPD) to assess the relative contributions of eye of origin and image features to integration across space at increasing IIPDs. Our hypothesis was that the balance between these contributions would shift toward image features as IIPD increased. Instead, results show that the relative contributions of both factors to grouping remain constant as a function of IIPD. This indicates that imagebased grouping is subject to similar spatial constraints as monocular, eye-based grouping, suggesting both kinds of grouping rely on similarly sized receptive fields. © 2017 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: AA was measured from the dominant eye of 120 fully corrected subjects using the ML procedure when viewing the target at both 33 and 40 cm. Each measurement was repeated between 24 and 48 hours after the first trial. Results: Mean AA when tested at 33 cm and 40 cm was 10.20 diopter (D) (standard deviation [SD] =1.24) and 8.85 D (SD = 1.23), respectively (P < 0.001). The limits of agreement of the measured amplitude calculated with taking into account of the replicates at 33 and 40 cm were-0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI]:-0.34 to-0.04) and 2.53 (95% CI: 2.38 to 2.68), respectively. The repeatability of testing at the two distances 33 and 40 cm was ± 1.24 and ± 0.99, respectively. In addition, the retest reliability of measured amplitude using the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.789-0.920) at 33 cm and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.872-0.945) at 40 cm. Conclusion: There is no agreement in the obtained amplitude at the two measurement distances. Testing the ML AA at 40 cm may be superior given that a lower repeatability coefficient was observed. However, it is unclear whether the larger amplitude measured at 33 cm reflects a larger increase in accommodation (greater proximity effect) or a decrease in the ability to perceive the first slight sustained blur.

These perceptual interpretations may alternate stochastically, a phenomenon known as bistability. Some classes of bistable stimuli, including binocular rivalry, are sensitive to bias from input through other modalities, such as sound and touch. Here, we address the question whether bistable visual motion stimuli, known as plaids, are affected by vestibular input that is caused by self-motion. In Experiment 1, we show that a vestibular self-motion signal biases the interpretation of the bistable plaid, increasing or decreasing the likelihood of the plaid being perceived as globally coherent or transparently sliding depending on the relationship between self-motion and global visual motion directions. In Experiment 2, we find that when the vestibular direction is orthogonal to the visual direction, the vestibular self-motion signal also biases the direction of one-dimensional motion. This interaction suggests that the effect in Experiment 1 is due to the self-motion vector adding to the visual motion vectors. Together, this demonstrates that the perception of visual motion direction can be systematically affected by concurrent but uninformative and task-irrelevant vestibular input caused by self-motion. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

METHODS: In this retrospective case series, 36 consecutive patients (72 eyes) who underwent simultaneous bi-aspheric ablation (PresbyMAX: SCHWIND Eye-Tech-Solutions GmbH and Co KG, Kleinostheim, Germany) in the non-dominant eye and monofocal regular LASIK in the dominant eye for correction of hyperopia and presbyopia were reviewed for 1 year. Binocular uncorrected distance (UDVA), near (UNVA), corrected distance (CDVA), and distance corrected near (DCNVA) visual acuity and manifest refraction were analyzed postoperatively. RESULTS: At 1 year, the mean binocular UDVA improved significantly from 0.26 ± 0.25 to 0.039 ± 0.088 logMAR (P < .001). Binocular UNVA also improved from 0.73 ± 0.30 to 0.10 ± 0.22 logRAD (P < .001). Eighty-seven percent of patients achieved UDVA of 20/25 or better and 90% had UNVA of J3 or better. Simultaneous binocular distance and near vision of 20/25 and J2 or better was achieved in 70%. Only 17% of patients had a binocular DCNVA of J2 or better. No patient suffered from a loss of 2 lines of CDVA. Refractive stability was achieved for both eyes from 1 month postoperatively. The re-treatment rate was 14% for improvement of near vision within 6 months to 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Presbyopic correction using monocular PresbyMAX combined with monofocal regular LASIK in the fellow eye is safe and acceptable in hyperopic patients. Copyright © SLACK Incorporated.

CD negatively impacts an individual's ability to accurately aim and fire long-barreled guns. The authors developed and evaluated a hand dominance transfer (HDT) intervention to improve the M16 rifle shooting accuracy, efficiency, and skill transfer. Twenty-four U.S. Army soldiers with CD were taught how to handle and fire an M16 rifle using the nondominant hand. Training was conducted at a military, indoor laser-equipped weapons simulator. Accuracy for shooting 40 rounds at baseline with the nondominant eye and dominant hand (NDE/DH) was 22.12 compared to shooting 30.46 with the dominant eye and nondominant hand (DE/NDH). This difference was statistically significant with p =.000. The transfer of shooting accuracy skill (retention) following the HDT intervention was 33.42 with a comparative p value of.100. Efficiency of shooting 10 rounds at baseline with the NDE/DH was 6.3 compared to shooting 7.3 with the DE/NDH. This difference was not statistically significant (p =.107). The transfer of shooting efficiency skill (retention) was 7.96 with a comparative p value of.349. This study supports shooting with the DE/NDH. HDT could be further developed to address the soldiering skill of shooting an M16. ©, This article not subject to US copyright law.

Here we explore a phenomenon that involves controlled perceptual disappearance of a peripheral visual stimulus without these limitations. It occurs when one eye's stimulus is abruptly removed during a binocular rivalry situation. This manipulation renders the remaining stimulus, which is still being presented to the other eye, invisible for up to several seconds. Our results suggest that this perceptual disappearance depends on a visual offset-transient that promotes dominance of the eye in which it occurs regardless of whether the eye is dominant or suppressed at the moment of the transient event. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that standard rivalry mechanisms of interocular inhibition can indeed be complemented by a hypothesized transient-driven gating mechanism to explain the phenomenon. In essence, such a system suggests that visual awareness is dominated by the eye that receives transients and ''sticks with'' this eye-based dominance for some time in the absence of further transient events. We refer to this phenomenon as the ""disrupted rivalry effect"" and suggest that it is a potentially powerful paradigm for the study of cortical suppression mechanisms and the neural correlates of visual awareness."
"Ding J.; Levi D.M.";0.0;Binocular combination of luminance profiles;2017;Journal of Vision;10.1167/17.13.4;We develop and test a new two-dimensional model for binocular combination of the two eyes' luminance profiles. For first-order stimuli, the model assumes that one eye's luminance profile first goes through a luminance compressor, receives gain-control and gainenhancement from the other eye, and then linearly combines the other eye's output profile. For secondorder stimuli, rectification is added in the signal path of the model before the binocular combination site. Both the total contrast and luminance energies, weighted sums over both the space and spatial-frequency domains, were used in the interocular gain-control, while only the total contrast energy was used in the interocular gain-enhancement. To challenge the model, we performed a binocular brightness matching experiment over a large range of background and target luminances. The target stimulus was a dichoptic disc with a sharp edge that has an increment or decrement luminance from its background. The disk's interocular luminance ratio varied from trial to trial. To refine the model we tested three luminance compressors, five nested binocular combination models (including the Ding-Sperling and the DSKL models), and examined the presence or absence of total luminance energy in the model. We found that (1) installing a luminance compressor, either a logarithmic luminance function or luminance gain-control, (2) including both contrast and luminance energies, and (3) adding interocular gainenhancement (the DSKL model) to a combined model significantly improved its performance. The combined model provides a systematic account of binocular luminance summation over a large range of luminance input levels. It gives a unified explanation of Fechner's paradox observed on a dark background, and a winnertake- all phenomenon observed on a light background. To further test the model, we conducted two additional experiments: luminance summation of discs with asymmetric contour information (Experiment 2), similar to Levelt (1965) and binocular combination of secondorder contrast-modulated gratings (Experiment 3). We used the model obtained in Experiment 1 to predict the results of Experiments 2 and 3 and the results of our previous studies. Model simulations further refined the contrast space weight and contrast sensitivity functions that are installed in the model, and provide a reasonable account for rebalancing of imbalanced binocular vision by reducing the mean luminance in the dominant eye. © 2017 The Authors.
"Dieter K.C.; Sy J.L.; Blake R.";0.0;Persistent biases in binocular rivalry dynamics within the visual field;2017;Vision (Switzerland);10.3390/vision1030018;Binocular rivalry is an important tool for measuring sensory eye dominance—the relative strength of sensory processing in an individual’s left and right eye. By dichoptically presenting images that lack corresponding visual features, one can induce perceptual alternations and measure the relative visibility of each eye’s image. Previous results indicate that observers demonstrate reliable preferences for several image features, and that these biases vary within the visual field. However, evidence about the persistence of these biases is mixed, with some suggesting they affect only the onset (i.e., first second) of rivalry, and others suggesting lasting effects during prolonged viewing. We directly investigated individuals’ rivalry biases for eye and color within the visual field and interestingly found results that mirrored the somewhat contradictory pattern in the literature. Each observer demonstrated idiosyncratic patterns of biases for both color and eye within the visual field, but consistent, prolonged biases only for the eye of presentation (sensory eye dominance, SED). Furthermore, the strength of eye biases predicted one’s performance on a stereoacuity task. This finding supports the idea that binocular rivalry and other binocular visual functions may rely on shared mechanisms, and emphasizes the importance of SED as a measure of binocular vision. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Groups of the subjects with right or left dominant eye, as well as right- or lefthanded solved the problems of Go/NoGo of various perceptual complexity. As a result, significant differences were found in the amplitude of components of evoked potentials N200 and P300. The differences in the amplitude N200 in the right temporal lead were found between the subjects with the right and left vectors of lateral asymmetry in 2 tasks in both conditions (Go and NoGo) in the lead T6, and they may speak for the independence of color processing of stimuli from the need to inhibit the response, as well as for the fact that in the early stage of processing the stimuli there are differences in color processing. The differences in the amplitude of the component P300 are seen in a wide range of leads and may be linked to perceptual complexity of the visual stimuli. The usage of cognitive control responses varies in groups with right and left vectors of lateral asymmetry. In the task where the relevant stimuli are out of the context, more differences are registered in the condition that demands inhibition of the irrelevant response (NoGo); in the task where stimuli are integrated in the context, more differences are registered in the condition that doesn't demand the inhibition (Go). This fact speaks for the differences in performance of control in subjects with various types of lateral asymmetry, when they answer various types of stimuli. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

The fluctuation rate and predominance ratio of these images are regarded as information source for understanding properties of consciousness and perception. We administered a binocular rivalry task to 26 right-hemisphere stroke patients and 26 healthy control participants, using stimuli such as simple Gabor anaglyphs. Each single Gabor image was of unequal spatial frequency compared to its counterpart, allowing assessment of the effect of relative spatial frequency on rivalry predominance. Results revealed that patients had significantly decreased alternation rate compared to healthy controls, with severity of patients’ attention impairment predicting alternation rates. The patient group had higher predominance ratio for high compared to low relative spatial frequency stimuli consistent with the hypothesis that damage to the right hemisphere may disrupt processing of relatively low spatial frequencies. Degree of attention impairment also predicted the effect of relative spatial frequencies. Lastly, both groups showed increased predominance rates in the right eye compared to the left eye. This right eye dominance was more pronounced in patients than controls, suggesting that right hemisphere stroke may additionally affect eye predominance ratios. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

An accurate and stable ultrasound image is fundamental for obtaining good quality images, consequently permitting accurate needle placement. We hypothesized that the dominant hand could be used to perform echography, leaving the non-dominant hand available for peripheral venous catheter (PVC) insertion. Methods Prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover study. Group 1 inserted the PVC with the dominant hand, and held the probe with the non-dominant hand in a first series of 20 insertions, and vice versa in a second series of 20 insertions performed 11 days later. Group 2 punctured with the non-dominant hand in Series 1 and vice versa in series 2. The study population comprised female student nurses (aged 20–30 years) who had learned neither ultrasound techniques nor catheter insertion. The primary endpoint was time to successful puncture. We recorded age, sex, video game use, and the laterality of hands, feet and eyes. Results One left-handed and nine right-handed nurses were randomized to each group. Puncture by the non-dominant hand was significantly quicker in both series (P < 0.001). There was no difference between groups for time to successful puncture with the dominant hand; however a significant difference was found for the non-dominant hand (P < 0.01). According to multivariate analysis, the time to successful puncture was significantly lower when the non-dominant hand was used to puncture (adjusted difference 5.6 s, P < 0.0001). Conclusion Using the dominant hand to hold the ultrasound probe and the non-dominant hand to puncture and insert the catheter achieves successful insertion in a significantly shorter time. © 2016 Société française d'anesthésie et de réanimation (Sfar)"

When a visual stimulus appears eccentrically in one visual-hemifield, it will first activate the contralateral hemisphere but also the ipsilateral one with a slight delay due to the interhemispheric transfer. This interhemispheric transfer of visual information is believed to be faster from the right to the left hemisphere in right-handers. Such an asymmetry is considered as a relevant fact in the context of the lateralization of the human brain. We show here using current source density (CSD) analyses of visually evoked potential (VEP) that, in right-handers and, to a lesser extent in left-handers, this asymmetry is in fact dependent on the sighting eye dominance, the tendency we have to prefer one eye for monocular tasks. Indeed, in right-handers, a faster interhemispheric transfer of visual information from the right to left hemisphere was observed only in participants with a right dominant eye (DE). Right-handers with a left DE showed the opposite pattern, with a faster transfer from the left to the right hemisphere. In left-handers, albeit a smaller number of participants has been tested and hence confirmation is required, only those with a right DE showed an asymmetrical interhemispheric transfer with a faster transfer from the right to the left hemisphere. As a whole these results demonstrate that eye dominance is a fundamental determinant of asymmetries in interhemispheric transfer of visual information and suggest that it is an important factor of brain lateralization. © 2018 Chaumillon, Blouin and Guillaume.

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between palpebral fissure height (PFH) and ocular dominance. Sixty-nine healthy volunteers (42 female, 27 male) were included in this research, and ocular dominance was determined using hole-in-the-card and pointing-a-finger tests. Those volunteers with inconsistent test results were excluded. Standard photographs were taken of all of the subjects in the primary position with a consistent background and photographic equipment. The PFHs were measured using an ImageJ analyser, and a mixed ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis. Overall, 87% of the participants showed small differences in their PFHs, with their dominant eyes being significantly wider than their non-dominant eyes (10.51 ± 0.97 vs. 10.32 ± 1.03; p =.001). This study revealed that ocular dominance has a significant effect on the PFH.

Thirty-two males, aged 20–39 years, with normal foveal logMAR letter acuity and no observed ocular abnormalities participated in the study. Achromatic and isolated L- and M-cone spatial acuity was measured in the dominant eye with a Sloan E letter of 90% achromatic decrement contrast or 23% increment cone contrast, respectively. Separately, the central part of the same eye was imaged with high-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO). Thickness measures and cone density in the fovea and parafoveal region were not correlated with perifoveal structural measures. A significant correlation was observed between thicker retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) complex, higher cone density and better L-cone logMAR at 5 deg eccentricity, but not for achromatic or M-cone logMAR. The results imply that single letter perifoveal L-cone acuity, rather than achromatic acuity, may provide a useful measure for assessing the structure-function relationship and detecting early changes in the perifoveal cone mosaic. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd
"Zhou J.; Hess R.F.";0.0;Quantification and Modulation of Stereopsis in Humans;2018;Digest of Technical Papers - SID International Symposium;10.1002/SDTP.12640;"Binocular vision in general and stereopsis in particular are fundamental to human vision and visual actions. It is widely thought that about 5% of the population have a lazy eye and lack stereo vision, so it is often supposed that most of the population (95%) have good stereo abilities. We show that this is not the case; 68% have good to excellent stereo (the haves) and 32% have moderate to poor stereo (the have-nots). Why so many people lack good 3-D stereo vision is unclear but it is likely to be neural and reversible. Interocular suppression and stereopsis are two important binocular functions. To date, it still remains unclear about the relationship between them. Here, we use the binocular phase combination paradigm and a comparable paradigm to provide a normative dataset for perceptual eye dominance and stereo acuity in 142 normal-sighted human adults and analyze their correlation. We show that our eye dominance and stereopsis are not strongly correlated in the normal-sighted subjects. These results thus support the idea that the binocular phase combination and stereopsis may be limited by different factors in normal-sighted adults. At present there is no good way of reliably measuring stereopsis in the clinic other than the standard book tests designed for children. These are convenient but coarsely quantized in disparity with no measure of variance. This makes it difficult to be able to assess the significance of differences from visit to visit contingent on therapy. We report an iPod app that has been developed from laboratory studies of normal stereopsis, to measure stereo in the clinic that is not limited by these factors. The application enables measurements over the wide disparity range and not just at the finest disparities. In addition, it allows changes in stereopsis of the order of 1.9 to be statistically distinguished. Luminance plays a modulating role in the processes of several visual tasks, which in turn provides significant information for the understanding of visual processing. To study the relationship between luminance and stereopsis, we manipulated the mean luminance seen by both eyes or the interocular difference in mean luminance by using ND filters placed in front of both eyes or just one eye respectively. We found that disparity processing was little affected by a binocular change in luminance, but was greatly affected by a luminance mismatch between the two eyes. To investigate its origin we manipulated two factors, the temporal synchrony between the two eyes and the interocular contrast. Both factors are implicated in the loss of stereo performance when the mean luminance is different between the eyes, suggesting an underlying explanation in terms of temporal low-pass filtering resulting in the combination of a luminance-dependent temporal delay and a luminance-dependent change in contrast gain. These results add to our knowledge of stereopsis and have therapeutic potential in re-establishing stereopsis in patients with binocular disorders. © 2018 SID."

The Optic disc and cup are segmented as clusters and its CDR is calculated through mathematical quantifications. The results are tabulated and scrutinized which clearly shows the percentage and risk factor of glaucoma. The screened results can be further extended for clinical suites. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

We address one question, is this enhancement from exercise a general effect such that it is seen for measures of binocular processing other than that revealed using binocular rivalry? Using a binocular phase combination task in which we directly measure each eye's contribution to the binocularly fused percept, we show no additional effect of exercise after short-term monocular occlusion and argue that the enhancement of ocular dominance plasticity from exercise could not be demonstrated with our approach. © 2017 Jiawei Zhou et al.

We investigated in healthy individuals spontaneous IPC during joint maximum forward reaching. A ‘contact-provider’ (CP; n = 2) kept light interpersonal touch (IPT) laterally with the wrist of the extended arm of a forward reaching, blind-folded ‘contact-receiver’ (CR; n = 22). Due to the stance configuration, CP was intrinsically more stable. CR received haptic feedback during forward reaching in two ways: (1) presence of a light object (OBT) at the fingertips, (2) provision of IPT. CP delivered IPT with or without vision or tracked manually with vision but without IPT. CR's variabilities of Centre-of-Pressure velocity (CoP) and wrist velocity, interpersonal cross-correlations and time lags served as outcome variables. OBT presence increased CR's reaching amplitude and reduced postural variability in the reach end-state. CR's variability was lowest when CP applied IPT without vision. OBT decreased the strength of IPC. Correlation time lags indicated that CP retained a predominantly reactive mode with CR taking the lead. When CP had no vision, presumably preventing an effect of visual dominance, OBT presence made a qualitative difference: with OBT absent, CP was leading CR. This observation might indicate a switch in CR's coordinative strategy by attending mainly to CP's haptic ‘anchor’. Our paradigm implies that in clinical settings the sensorimotor states of both interacting partners need to be considered. We speculate that haptic guidance by a caregiver is more effective when IPT resembles the only link between both partners. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

In this study, we investigated attention-related modulations of the stimulus-locked event-related potential (ERP) and occipital oscillations in the alpha band (8–14 Hz) in young and elderly participants. Both groups performed a visual attention task equally well and the ERP showed comparable attention-related modulations in both age groups. However, in elderly subjects, oscillations in the alpha band were massively reduced both during the task and in the resting state and the typical task-related lateralized pattern of alpha activity was not observed. These differences between young and elderly participants were observed on the group level as well as on the single trial level.

However, our previous study found that an optimal individual attentional strategy depended on motor imagery ability. We explored whether the individual motor imagery ability in stroke patients also affected the optimal attentional strategy for motor control. Individual motor imagery ability was determined as either kinesthetic- or visual-dominant by a questionnaire in 28 patients and 28 healthy-controls. Participants then performed a visuomotor task that required tracing a trajectory under three attentional conditions: no instruction (NI), attention to hand movement (IF), or attention to cursor movement (EF). Movement error in the stroke group strongly depended on individual modality dominance of motor imagery. Patients with kinesthetic dominance showed higher motor accuracy under the IF condition but with concomitantly lower velocity. Alternatively, patients with visual dominance showed improvements in both speed and accuracy under the EF condition. These results suggest that the optimal attentional strategy for improving motor accuracy in stroke rehabilitation differs according to the individual dominance of motor imagery. Our findings may contribute to the development of tailor-made pre-assessment and rehabilitation programs optimized for individual cognitive abilities. © The Author(s) 2017.

According to binocular rivalry, a weighted ensemble learning network is developed for learning energy of dominant eye.

In Experiment 1, participants did not use a crosshair. Results showed that mean distance from target was smaller with cyclopean than with dominant or non-dominant eyes. In Experiment 2, participants controlled a crosshair with their cyclo-pean, dominant and non-dominant eye intermittently and had to align the crosshair with the target. Overall tracking accuracy was highest with cyclopean eye, yet similar between cyclopean and dominant eye in the second half of the experiment. From a theoretical viewpoint, our findings correspond with the cyclopean eye theory of egocentric direction and provide indication for eye dominance, in accordance with the hemispheric laterality approach.

Yet it is unknown whether the ability to link emotional signals across modalities depends on early experience with audio-visual stimuli. In the present study, we investigated the role of auditory experience at different stages of development for auditory, visual, and multisensory emotion recognition abilities in three groups of adolescent and adult cochlear implant (CI) users. CI users had a different deafness onset and were compared to three groups of age- and gender-matched hearing control participants. We hypothesized that congenitally deaf (CD) but not early deaf (ED) and late deaf (LD) CI users would show reduced multisensory interactions and a higher visual dominance in emotion perception than their hearing controls. The CD (n = 7), ED (deafness onset: <3 years of age; n = 7), and LD (deafness onset: >3 years; n = 13) CI users and the control participants performed an emotion recognition task with auditory, visual, and audio-visual emotionally congruent and incongruent nonsense speech stimuli. In different blocks, participants judged either the vocal (Voice task) or the facial expressions (Face task). In the Voice task, all three CI groups performed overall less efficiently than their respective controls and experienced higher interference from incongruent facial information. Furthermore, the ED CI users benefitted more than their controls from congruent faces and the CD CI users showed an analogous trend. In the Face task, recognition efficiency of the CI users and controls did not differ. Our results suggest that CI users acquire multisensory interactions to some degree, even after congenital deafness. When judging affective prosody they appear impaired and more strongly biased by concurrent facial information than typically hearing individuals. We speculate that limitations inherent to the CI contribute to these group differences. © 2017 Fengler et al.

Aims The aims of this study were to determine the feasibility of social scene eye tracking and pupillometry measures in individuals with AS and to compare the performance of AS participants to individuals with idiopathic Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and typically developing controls (TDC). Methods and procedures Individuals with AS and age- and gender- matched controls completed a social eye tracking paradigm. Neurobehavioral characterization of AS participants was completed via a battery of psychological testing and caregiver behavioral evaluations. Outcomes and results Eight of seventeen recruited AS participants completed the eye tracking paradigm. Compared to TDC, AS subjects demonstrated significantly less preference for social scenes than geometric shapes. Additionally, AS subjects showed less pupil dilation, compared to TDC, when viewing social scenes versus geometric shapes. There was no statistically significant difference found between AS and ASD subjects in either social eye tracking or pupillometry. Conclusions and implications The use of eye tracking and pupillometry may represent an innovative measure for quantifying AS-associated impairments in social salience. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd
"Boon P.J.; Theeuwes J.; Belopolsky A.V.";0.0;Eye abduction reduces but does not eliminate competition in the oculomotor system;2017;Journal of Vision;10.1167/17.5.15;Although it is well established that there is a tight coupling between covert attention and the eye movement system there is an ongoing controversy whether this relationship is functional. Previous studies demonstrated that disrupting the ability to execute an eye movement interferes with the allocation of covert attention. One technique that prevents the execution of an eye movement involves the abduction of the eye in the orbit while presenting the stimuli outside of the effective oculomotor range (Craighero, Nascimben, & Fadiga, 2004). Although eye abduction is supposed to disrupt activation of the oculomotor program responsible for the shift of covert attention, this crucial assumption has never been tested experimentally. In the present study we used saccadic curvature to examine whether eye abduction eliminates the target-distractor competition in the oculomotor system. We experimentally reduced the ability to execute saccades by abducting the eye by 308 (monocular vision). This way the peripheral part of the temporal hemifield was located outside the oculomotor range. Participants made a vertical eye movement while on some trials a distractor was shown either inside or outside of the oculomotor range. The curvature away from distractors located outside the oculomotor range was reduced, but not completely eliminated. This confirms that eye abduction influences the activation of the oculomotor program, but points to the fact that other forms of motor planning, such as head movements are also represented in the oculomotor system. The results are in line with the idea that covert attention is an emerging property of movement planning, but is not restricted to saccade planning. © 2017 The Authors.

Stimuli were sine-wave gratings of 2 c/deg presented within 2 deg circular apertures. The LM stimulus contrast was 0.1 and the CM stimulus modulation depth was 1.0, equating to approximately 5 and 7 times detection threshold, respectively. Twelve 45 s trials, per noise configuration, were carried out. Fifteen participants with normal vision indicated via button presses whether an exclusive, piecemeal or superimposed percept was seen. For all noise conditions LM stimuli generated more exclusive visibility, and lower proportions of superimposition. CM stimuli led to greater proportions and longer periods of superimposition. For both stimulus types, correlated interocular noise generated more superimposition than did anti- or uncorrelated interocular noise. No significant effect of stimulus type (LM vs CM) or noise configuration (correlated, uncorrelated, anti-correlated) on piecemeal perception was found. Exclusive visibility was greater in proportion, and perceptual changes more numerous, during binocular rivalry for CM stimuli when interocular noise was not correlated. This suggests that mutual inhibition, initiated by non-correlated noise CM gratings, occurs between neurons processing luminance noise (first-order component), as well as those processing gratings (second-order component). Therefore, first- and second-order components can contribute to overall binocular rivalry responses. We suggest the addition of a new well to the current energy landscape model for binocular rivalry that takes superimposition into account. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd
"Ramamurthy M.; Blaser E.";0.0;Assessing the kaleidoscope of monocular deprivation effects;2018;Journal of Vision;10.1167/18.13.14;"Short-term monocular deprivation (~150 min) temporarily shifts sensory eye balance in favor of the deprived eye (Lunghi, Burr, & Morrone, 2011; Zhou, Clavagnier, & Hess, 2013), opposite to classic deprivation studies (Hubel & Wiesel, 1970). Various types of deprivation-light-tight, diffuser lenses, image degradation-have been tested, and it seemed that a deprivation of contrast was necessary, and sufficient, for these shifts. This could be accommodated in a feedforward model of binocular combination (Meese, Georgeson, & Baker, 2006; Sperling & Ding, 2010), in which the shift reflects a (persistent) reweighting induced by an interocular gain control mechanism tasked with maintaining binocular balance (Zhou, Clavagnier, et al., 2013). Here, we used a novel ''kaleidoscopic'' monocular deprivation that, although it rendered images fractionated and uninformative, preserved gross luminance, color, spatial frequency, motion, and contrast information, effectively sneaking the image degradation past early, feedforward mechanisms, targeting higher levels. Kaleidoscopic deprivation produced effects indistinguishable from traditional light-tight patching. This rules out contrast imbalance as the sole factor driving these shifts in sensory eye balance. In addition, since the suppression of the kaleidoscopic image likely requires feedback from higher-level processes capable of determining the behavioral relevance of an eye's information (Foley & Miyanshi, 1969; Jiang, Costello, & He, 2007; Kovács, Papathomas, Yang, & Fehér, 1996; Wolf & Hochstein, 2011), feedforward-only models may need to be elaborated. © 2018 The Authors."

Abnormal binocular interactions are believed to play a critical role in amblyopia. These binocular deficits can often be resolved, owing to the residual visual plasticity in amblyopes. In this study, we quantitatively measured the sensory eye dominance in treated anisometropic amblyopes to determine whether they had fully recovered. Fourteen treated anisometropic amblyopes with normal or corrected to normal visual acuity participated, and their sensory eye dominance was assessed by using a binocular phase combination paradigm. We found that the two eyes were unequal in binocular combination in most (11 out of 14) of our treated anisometropic amblyopes, but none of the controls. We concluded that the treated anisometropic amblyopes, even those with a normal range of visual acuity, exhibited abnormal binocular processing. Our results thus suggest that there is potential for improvement in treated anisometropic amblyopes that may further enhance their binocular visual functioning. © 2017 Yao Chen et al.

This LVF advantage may reflect hemispheric asymmetry in temporal attention or/and in spatial orienting of attention. Participants performed two tasks: the “standard” bilateral RSVP task (Exp.1) and its unilateral variant (Exp.1 & 2). In the bilateral task, spatial location was uncertain, thus target identification involved stimulus-driven spatial orienting. In the unilateral task, the targets were presented block-wise in the LVF or RVF only, such that no spatial orienting was needed for target identification. Temporal attention was manipulated in both tasks by varying the T1-T2 lag. The results showed that the LVF advantage disappeared when involvement of stimulus-driven spatial orienting was eliminated, whereas the manipulation of temporal attention had no effect on the asymmetry. In conclusion, the results do not support the hypothesis of hemispheric asymmetry in temporal attention, and provide further evidence that the LVF advantage reflects right hemisphere predominance in stimulus-driven orienting of spatial attention. These conclusions fit evidence that temporal attention is implemented by bilateral parietal areas and spatial attention by the right-lateralized ventral frontoparietal network. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Cases and Method : This study was made on 17 patients with superior oblique palsy. Three cases were bilaterally affected. The palsy was congenital in 8 cases, following trauma in 4, and secondary to vascular accident in 3. Two cases were children and 8 cases were aged more than 40 years. Disc-to-fovea angle was measured by fundus photography of both eyes. Dominant eye was determined by hole-in-the-card method. Results : Pathological fundus extorsion was present in 9 out of 20 involved eyes (45%). Disc-to-fovea angle of the paretic eye averaged 7.7 ± 3.6 degrees when the paretic eye was the dominant eye. It was 17-5 - 2.4 degrees when the paretic eye was non-dominant. The difference was sig nificant (p<0.0l). Disc-to-fovea angle of the healthy eye averaged 11.0 ±3.5 degrees in unilaterally affected cases. The value was significandy larger than in healthy cases (p<0.05). Conclusion : Frequency of pathologically increased disc-to-fovea angle was not high in superior oblique palsy. Disc-to-fovea angle in nonparetlC by eye dominancy.

One recently described, compelling example of adult neural plasticity is the effect of patching one eye for a relatively short period of time: contrary to intuition, monocular visual deprivation actually improves the deprived eye's competitive advantage during a subsequent period of binocular rivalry [6–8], the robust form of visual competition prompted by dissimilar stimulation of the two eyes [9, 10]. Neural concomitants of this improvement in monocular dominance are reflected in measurements of brain responsiveness following eye patching [11, 12]. Here we report that patching an eye is unnecessary for producing this paradoxical deprivation effect: interocular suppression of an ordinarily visible stimulus being viewed by one eye is sufficient to produce shifts in subsequent predominance of that eye to an extent comparable to that produced by patching the eye. Moreover, this imbalance in eye dominance can also be induced by prior, extended viewing of two monocular images differing only in contrast. Regardless of how shifts in eye dominance are induced, the effect decays once the two eyes view stimuli equal in strength. These novel findings implicate the operation of interocular neural gain control that dynamically adjusts the relative balance of activity between the two eyes [13, 14]. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

We previously showed that sighting eye dominance has an influence on visually triggered manual action with shorter reaction time (RT) when the stimulus appears in the contralateral visual hemifield with respect to the dominant eye (Chaumillon et al. 2014). We also suggested that eye dominance may be more or less pronounced depending on individuals and that this eye dominance strength could be evaluated through saccadic peak velocity analysis in binocular recordings (Vergilino-Perez et al. 2012). Based on these two previous studies, we further examine here whether the strength of the eye dominance can modulate the influence of this lateralization on manual reaction time. Results revealed that participants categorized as having a strong eye dominance, but not those categorized as having a weak eye dominance, exhibited the difference in RT between the two visual hemifields. This present study reinforces that the analysis of saccade peak velocity in binocular recordings provides an effective tool to better categorize the eye dominance. It also shows that the influence of eye dominance in visuo-motor tasks depends on its strength. Our study also highlights the importance of considering the strength of eye dominance in future studies dealing with brain lateralization. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate two different surveys-CISS and Conlon for the same subject group and analyse also critical visual function parameters. Monocular and binocular accommodative response for 20 subjects was measured for dominant eye with openfield infrared autorefractometer (Shin-Nippon SRW-5000) at three distances (24 cm, 30 cm and 40 cm). Subjects were divided into symptomatic and asymptomatic group using cut off score 21 for CISS and 20 for Conlon survey. We found positive exponential growth relationship between CISS and Conlon scores (R= 0.7), but separation between symptomatic and asymptomatic group differed significantly depending on which survey was used. We found positive correlation between Conlon score and exophoria at 30 cm (r=0.41, p=0.01) and 24 cm (r=0.27, p=0.03). Relationship between subjective symptoms and following clinical parameters-accommodation lag (r < 0.2, p < 0.05), positive relative accommodation (r < 0.15, p < 0.05) and convergence near point (r = 0.26, p < 0.05) were not significant. Our results confirmed that using different subjective symptom surveys can provide different results within the same subject group, therefore we recommend to use surveys as a part of case history and tool to measure patient satisfaction and results of treatment effectiveness instead of using them for clinical trials as a criteria to divide symptomatic and asymptomatic group. © 2017 SPIE.

Methods: IB patients were submitted to two tests followed by observation of the effect on the contralateral eyelid: (1) ME of the more ptotic eyelid; and (2) instillation of two drops of 10% PE (phenylephrine test) in the more ptotic eye. The patients were filmed before and 5, 10, and 15 minutes after instillation. The upper eyelid margin reflex distance (MRD1) was measured using the software Image J, and the results were analyzed with the linear mixed-effects model. Results: The study included 70 patients aged 44–86 years, 64 of whom were female (91.43%), divided into three groups: subjects with unilateral IB, subjects with bilateral IB, and controls. The eye submitted to instillation with 10% PE displayed significant elevation during the first 10 min: from 1.33 ± 0.66 mm to 2.06 ± 0.89 mm (unilateral group), from 1.26 ± 0.63 mm to 2.29 ± 0.86 mm (bilateral group), and from 3.12 ± 0.68 mm to 4.06 ± 0.92 mm (control group). MRD1 decreased in the contralateral eye in IB patients, significantly more so after the phenylephrine test: PE vs. ME = 18.9% versus 17.2% reduction in the unilateral group, and 13.6% versus 10.7% reduction in the bilateral group. The outcome was not influenced by IB severity and the concurrence of IB and eye dominance. Conclusion: Both ME and 10% PE affected the contralateral upper eyelid, but the response was significantly better with the latter. © Taylor & Francis."

Although previous studies have suggested that preference for social stimuli in infancy is a possible indicator of later social communication development, little is known about this relation in preterm infants. We examined the gaze behavior of low-risk preterm and full-term infants at 6 and 12 months' corrected ages using two types of eye-tracking tasks, which measured 1) preference for social stimuli by biological motion and human geometric preference and 2) ability to follow another's gaze direction. We found that preterm (compared with full-term) infants at both 6 and 12 months of age spent less time looking toward dynamic human images, followed another's gaze less frequently, and looked for a shorter time at an object cued by another. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between looking time toward dynamic human images and frequency of gaze following at 12 months of age in full-term, but not preterm, infants. We discuss the relation between the atypical patterns of gaze behavior in preterm infants and their higher risk of later social communication problems.

Both healthy eyes of 16 subjects aged [20;30[ years were included. In each eye, a volume of the optical nerve head (ONH) was captured three times with a TOPCON DRI OCT Triton (Japan). Each volume renders a representation of the ONH 2.8 mm along the sagittal axis resolved in 993 steps, 6 mm long the frontal axis resolved in 512 steps and 6 x mm along the longitudinal axis resolved in 256 steps. The captured volumes were transferred to a custom made software for semiautomatic segmentation of PIMD around the circumference of the ONH. The phases of iterated volumes were calibrated with cross correlation. It was found that PIMD-2π expresses a double hump with a small maximum superiorly, a larger maximum inferiorly, and minima in between. The measurements indicated that there is no difference of PIMD-2€ between genders nor between dominant and not dominant eye within subject. The variation between eyes within subject is of the same order as the variation among subjects. The variation among volumes within eye is substantially lower. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

A total of 174 eyes of 87 normal Chinese subjects were enrolled in the study. The results showed that FAZ and CMT measurements are not statistically significant between right and left eyes, but right eyes had higher vascular density in superficial, deep retinal capillary and choriocapillaris networks, which might be related with dominant eyes. Spearman correlation test revealed a high correlation between right and left eyes for FAZ and CMT measurements (r = 0.934; r = 0.935), and a moderate correlation for SCP, DCP and CC density (r = 0.402; r = 0.666; r = 0.417). The analysis showed greater vascular density with smaller FAZ size, and a high negative relationship between FAZ and CMT, which indicates a positive correlation between retinal blood supply and retinal thickness. © 2017 The Author(s)."
"Schlossmacher I.; Junghöfer M.; Straube T.; Bruchmann M.";0.0;No differential effects to facial expressions under continuous flash suppression: An event-related potentials study;2017;NeuroImage;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.09.034;In recent years continuous flash suppression (CFS) has become a popular “blinding” technique for the investigation of nonconscious affective processing since it elicits potent and long-lasting suppression of conscious visual perception. While the majority of studies provides some positive evidence for nonconscious affective processing, there are also studies reporting their absence. Several methodological variations may give rise to this discrepancy: with respect to the experimental paradigm these variations pertain to the likelihood of residual stimulus visibility on the level of individual participants and single trials. Concerning the statistical analysis they relate to the procedures applied to assess whether detection performance is at chance level and whether the outcome measure does or does not depend on the affective stimulus category. In the present study we determined individual eye dominance and individual stimulus contrast in pretests, measured objective and subjective awareness online and applied Bayesian statistics to estimate the likelihood for the null hypothesis. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured while participants were subjected to fearful, happy, and neutral faces in a conscious as well as in a nonconscious CFS condition. In the conscious condition, expected emotion effects were observed in the ERP components N170/EPN and LPP. However, despite high statistical power, no effects of emotional expression were found in the nonconscious condition and the absence of nonconscious affective processing under the tested conditions was substantially more likely than its presence. We discuss whether CFS disrupts affective processing completely if thoroughly applied or whether positive and negative findings should be integrated under a two-threshold framework of nonconscious processing. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, alexithymia has been suggested to explain objective emotion processing deficits in EDs. We tested if elevated levels of alexithymia may explain emotional face-processing problems in a mixed ED group (N = 24, 19 with anorexia and five with bulimia), comparing them with high-alexithymic (N = 25) and low-alexithymic healthy controls (N = 25). Participants judged the mixture ratio of clear and ambiguous facial emotion blends while eye movements were recorded. The ED group was less accurate judging ambiguous blends containing anger or disgust and attended less to the faces compared with low-alexithymic controls. Reduced attention to faces, in particular the eye region, was linked to confusion with ambiguous anger and disgust in the ED group only. Although significant group differences only emerged compared with low-alexithymic controls, the visual attention patterns underlying the ED group's problems with subtle anger and disgust expressions were not driven by alexithymia.

However, amblyopia has abnormal visual cognition. Physiological changes of the brain during processes of cognition could be reflected with ERPs. So the purpose of this study was to investigate the speed and the capacity of resource allocation in visual cognitive processing in orientation discrimination task during monocular and binocular viewing conditions of amblyopia and normal control as well as the corresponding eyes of the two groups with ERPs. We also sought to investigate whether the speed and the capacity of resource allocation in visual cognitive processing vary with target stimuli at different spatial frequencies (3, 6 and 9 cpd) in amblyopia and normal control as well as between the corresponding eyes of the two groups. Fifteen mild to moderate anisometropic amblyopes and ten normal controls were recruited. Three-stimulus oddball paradigms of three different spatial frequency orientation discrimination tasks were used in monocular and binocular conditions in amblyopes and normal controls to elicit event-related potentials (ERPs). Accuracy (ACC), reaction time (RT), the latency of novelty P300 and P3b, and the amplitude of novelty P300 and P3b were measured. Results showed that RT was longer in the amblyopic eye than in both eyes of amblyopia and non-dominant eye in control. Novelty P300 amplitude was largest in the amblyopic eye, followed by the fellow eye, and smallest in both eyes of amblyopia. Novelty P300 amplitude was larger in the amblyopic eye than non-dominant eye and was larger in fellow eye than dominant eye. P3b latency was longer in the amblyopic eye than in the fellow eye, both eyes of amblyopia and non-dominant eye of control. P3b latency was not associated with RT in amblyopia. Neural responses of the amblyopic eye are abnormal at the middle and late stages of cognitive processing, indicating that the amblyopic eye needs to spend more time or integrate more resources to process the same visual task. Fellow eye and both eyes in amblyopia are slightly different from the dominant eye and both eyes in normal control at the middle and late stages of cognitive processing. Meanwhile, abnormal extents of amblyopic eye do not vary with three different spatial frequencies used in our study. © 2017 Wang et al.

The present study investigated perceptual differences in stimuli viewed binocularly or monocularly in the peripheral retina to determine how hue information combines across the two retinas for a stimulus falling on the temporal retina of one eye and the nasal retina of the other. A hue-scaling procedure was utilized to ascertain hue perception for three color- and binocular-normal observers viewing monochromatic stimuli (450–670 nm, 20 nm steps) ranging in size from 1.0° to 3.7°. Peripherally-presented binocular stimuli fell upon the nasal retina of one eye and the temporal retina of the other. Hue-scaling results indicated that peripheral binocular hue and saturation perceptions for smaller stimuli were more similar to those of stimuli falling on the temporal retina in the monocular condition. Hue-scaling data were also used to determine perceptive field sizes for the four elemental hues. Binocular perceptive field sizes were more similar to those obtained for stimuli falling on the temporal retina in the monocular conditions. Eye dominance did not appear to have an effect on hue perception. The results seem to indicate that visual information from the temporal retina is weighted more heavily when information from the two eyes is combined cortically. This finding may relate to differences in V1 cortical activation for stimuli presented to the nasal retina versus the temporal retina. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

To quantify ocular sensory dominance and investigate its relationship to stereopsis. METHOD. A total of 69 subjects participated in the study. Ocular dominance was measured by a continuous flashing technique, with the tested eye viewing a Gabor patch increasing in contrast, and the fellow eye viewing a Mondrian noise decreasing in contrast. In each trial, the log ratio of Mondrian to Gabor’s contrasts was recorded as a subject first detected the Gabor. We collected 50 trials for each eye and an interocular difference was analyzed with a rank-sum test. The z-value was used as the ocular dominance index (ODI) to quantify the degree of ocular dominance. A subject with ODI ≥ 2 was categorized as having a clear ocular dominance, and a subject with ODI < 2 was considered as having balanced eyes (unclear dominance). The stereoacuity was measured with random dot patterns with durations varying from 50 to 1000 ms. The best achievable stereoacuity (Dmin) and the integration time needed to acquire that (Tmin) were calculated. RESULTS. A total of 30 subjects had balanced eyes and 39 had clear ocular dominance. Tmin was significantly longer in subjects with clear ocular dominance than in subjects with balanced eyes (180.18 vs. 121.17 ms, P < 0.01). Tmin was positively correlated with ODI (P < 0.01). However, Dmin in subjects with clear dominance was not different from that in subjects with balanced eyes (40.60 vs. 35.73 arcsec, P = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS. Ocular dominance is not associated with how fine the stereoacuity is, but rather how quickly the best stereoacuity is acquired. © 2018 The Authors.

In this paper, we propose an efficient blind image quality assessment model for stereoscopic images according to binocular adding and subtracting channels. Different from other SIQA methods which focus on complex binocular visual properties, we simply use the visual information from adding and subtracting to describe binocularity (also known as ocular dominance) which is closely related to distortion types. To better evaluate the contribution of each channel in SIQA, a dynamic weighting is introduced according to local energy. Meanwhile, distortion-aware features based on wavelet transform are utilized to describe visual degradation. Experimental results on 3D image databases demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework in predicting stereoscopic image quality. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

Their contribution to phylogenic and ontogenetic development of human, have been well documented by neuroscientific data. Since the second half of the twentieth century, researchers and sport psychologists, were concerned with the contribution of hand and eye dominance to aiming skills. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ipsilateral and contralateral eye-hand dominance in tennis serve accuracy. Forty-one right handed amateur tennis players, 22 males and 19 females, mean age 20,9 (SD= ±0.66 years) participated in this study. The mean training age in this period was one to three years. According to ipsilateral and contralaterar eye-hand dominance, sample was divided into two groups: contralateral eye-hand dominance group, including 21 participants (11 males and 10 females) and ipsilateral eye-hand dominance group, including 20 participants (11 males and 9 females). Hand dominance was defined by two different tests, showing the same results. Participants were asked to serve 20 times (10 serves from the “deuce side” of court and 10 from the “advantage side”). Serve accuracy was examined by two experienced, independent examiners. One way Anova analysis has shown no significant differences in accuracy test between the two groups of contralateral and ispilateral eye-hand dominance. However, contralateral group achieved higher scores in accuracy from the deuce court with mean score 5,71 against 5,45 of the ipsilateral goup. Those findings are in contrast to previous studies with regard to aiming tasks. On another study which is currently in progress, the hypothesis about the impact of ipsilateral and contralateral hand - eye dominance on tennis serves accuracy is being examined in professional tennis players. © JPES.

This error does not change the findings and conclusions drawn in the article. The analyses that were affected are reported in full in the text below. We have included the whole report of each analysis, even though the BIT-score changes did not affect all values. 2 Methods 2.1 Participants (p.86–87) The study included 26 participants with right-hemisphere unilateral stroke, of which 13 were diagnosed with unilateral spatial neglect and the other 13 had mild attention impairments. Accordingly the patients were divided into subgroups of 13 neglect patients and 13 patients without neglect (see Table 2). The age of neglect patients ranged between 36 and 63 (M = 53.00, SD = 8.86), while the age of patients without neglect ranged between 20 and 73 (M = 52.54, SD = 17.24). T-tests showed that the difference in age between the subgroups of patients were not significant, t(17.93) = −0.086, p = 0.933 (equal variances not assumed). Handedness scores from Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI; Oldfield, 1971) were also compared between subgroups, and there were no significant differences between patients with neglect (M = 77.85, SD = 55.04) and patients without neglect (M = 63.31, SD = 66.64), t(24) = −0.607, p = 0.550. Chi square analyses of dichotomous variables were used to consider differences in gender and ocular dominance distribution between groups. Patient subgroups did not differ significantly in regards to gender distribution, as the neglect group had 4 females and 9 males while the group without neglect had 2 females and 11 males, χ2 (2, n = 26) = 0.867, p = 0.352. Neither did the groups differ significantly in ocular dominance, with 7 left-ocular dominant and 6 right-ocular dominant participants in each patient subgroup, χ2 (1, n = 26) = 0.000, p = 1.000. 3 Results 3.1 Effects of relative spatial frequency and eye (p.90): A simple regression with Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT)-scores predicting predominance ratios of relatively low spatial frequency percepts was significant, F(1, 22) = 12.022, p < 0.002, with R = 0.594 and R2 = 0.353, explaining 35.3% of the variance in predominance (see Fig. 4). A simple regression was run assessing BIT-scores ability to predict right eye predominance ratio, but this was not significant, F(1, 22) = 1.607, p = 0.218, with R = 0.261 and R2 = 0.068. 3.3 Group differences in alternation rates (p.91): Moreover, the independent samples t-test comparing alternation rates between neglect patients (M = 2.70, SD = 3.19) and mild attention impairment patients (M = 9.46, SD = 11.30), was significant, t (24) = −2.08, p = 0.049 (two-tailed). The difference in means (Mean difference = −6.77, 95% CI: −13.48 to −0.05) was also of a large magnitude (η2 = 0.152). 3.4 Age and behavioral inattention test-scores predicting alternation rates (p.91): A multiple regression with BIT-score and Age predicting alternation rate in patients is presented in Table 7. Zero-order correlations were computed amongst the three variables to assess the relationship between each of them. Behavioral Inattention Test-scores (BIT) were positively related to alternations, r(26) = 0.388, p = 0.025, Age was negatively related to alternations, r(26) = −0.369, p = 0.032, and BIT-score and Age were not significantly correlated to each other, r(26) = 0.020, p = 0.461. The separate contribution of BIT-scores in the patient group was significant with sr2 = 0.157, t(23) = 2.257, p = 0.034. In other words, the negative slope for BIT-scores indicated that BIT-scores explained a significant 15.7% proportion of the variance in alternation rates in this group (as illustrated in Fig. 6 a). Age also significantly predicted alternation rate when BIT-scores were controlled for, sr2 = 0.142, t(23) = −2.151, p = 0.042, and significantly accounted for 14.2% of variance in the patient group (Fig. 6b). 4 Discussion 4.1 A general increase in dominance duration in patients (p.92): The Patients’ Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) -scores were able to explain only a small part of the variance in alternation rates (15.7%). 4.4 Behavioral inattention test (BIT) and age predict alternation rates (p.94): The effect of age was not particularly strong in the patient group, explaining only 14.2% unique variance in alternation rates. The BIT-scores’ ability to predict alternation rates in patients was surprisingly low, as only 15.7% unique variance could be explained.

The result reveals that there are statistically significant differences in interocular dominance between two groups, evidencing a greater suppressive imbalance in amblyopic subjects. The technique used, proved to be a simple, easy to apply and economic method, for quantified ocular dominance. It is presented as a technique with the potential to accompany subjects with a marked dominance in one of the eyes that makes fusion difficult. © 2017 SPIE.

The hypothesis of our study was that the impact of AMD will be different between unilateral and bilateral AMD subjects compared to age-matched healthy elderly. Methods: Postural stability was measured with a platform (TechnoConcept®) in 10 elderly unilateral AMD subjects (mean age: 71.1 ± 4.6 years), 10 elderly bilateral AMD subjects (mean age: 70.8 ± 6.1 years), and 10 healthy age-matched control subjects (mean age: 69.8 ± 6.3 years). Four visual conditions were tested: both eyes viewing condition (BEV), dominant eye viewing (DEV), non-dominant eye viewing (NDEV), and eyes closed (EC). We analyzed the surface area, the length, the mean speed, the anteroposterior (AP), and mediolateral (ML) displacement of the center of pressure (CoP). Results: Bilateral AMD subjects had a surface area (p < 0.05) and AP displacement of the CoP (p < 0.01) higher than healthy elderly. Unilateral AMD subjects had more AP displacement of the CoP (p < 0.05) than healthy elderly. Conclusions: We suggest that ADM subjects could have poor postural adaptive mechanisms leading to increase their postural instability. Further studies will aim to improve knowledge on such issue and to develop reeducation techniques in these patients. © 2017 Chatard, Tepenier, Jankowski, Aussems, Allieta, Beydoun, Salah and Bucci.

Methods: The clinical records of all new patients with FTMH, referred between 2008 and 2014, were reviewed for demographics, cause of the FTMH, age at diagnosis, symptom duration, laterality, visual acuity (VA), axial length and lens status. A detailed analysis of the patients’ spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images was performed, and the primary FTMHs were classified in clinical stages according to the IVTS classification. From the SD-OCT, accurate macula drawings were made by means of a computer-drawing software. By merging these drawings and displaying them as colour-coded maps, the morphology and shape of the FTMH were visualized. Results: The study included 177 eyes (152 primary and 25 secondary FTMH) in 166 patients. In primary FTMH, the male-to-female ratio was 1:2.2. The age- and gender-adjusted annual incidences of primary FTMH were 7.9 eyes and 7.4 individuals per 100 000 inhabitants. Mean primary FTMH minimum linear diameter (MLD) and basal diameter (BD) were 435 μm and 872 μm, respectively, and 13% were classified as small, 31% as medium and 55% as large. Vitreomacular traction (VMT) and epiretinal membrane (ERM) were present in 34% and 36% of the eyes, respectively. Conclusion: This study provides data on the incidence rates of FTMH adjusted to different standard populations. The morphological analysis and novel computational visualization technique offer new insight into the structural complexity of FTMH and how VMT and ERM significantly influence FTMH configuration. © 2017 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

However, recent evidence has emerged suggesting these findings are explained by low-level visual features rather than emotional salience. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that emotional salience increases both blindsight (i.e., detection with reduced awareness) and awareness of visually suppressed stimuli. We used fear conditioning to manipulate the emotional significance of neutral expressions presented under Continuous Flash Suppression. Fifty-two healthy participants were presented with perithreshold neutral faces, previously paired with an electric shock (CS+) or not (CS−), and asked to localise the quadrant wherein faces were presented and rate their level of confidence in the response. Results showed fear conditioning strength (indexed by skin conductance response to CS+ versus CS−) was positively associated with both increased “blindsight” and awareness of conditioned stimuli. These findings suggest emotional significance alone, and not merely low-level visual differences, can enhance pre-conscious and conscious processing of visual stimuli. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

Methods: This prospective institutional study included hyperopic anisometropic patients with and without amblyopia, aged between 6 and 40 years. The refractive error and the values of keratometry, axial length (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and central macular thickness (CMT) obtained using the RK-F1 autorefractor, LenStar LS-900, and Spectralis optical coherence tomography were compared between the higher hyperopic and fellow eyes. Results: Eighty of the patients had hyperopic anisometropia with amblyopia and 30 of them had hyperopic anisometropia without amblyopia. The left eyes of the patients in this series were significantly more commonly affected. Axial length and CCT were significantly different between the higher hyperopic and the fellow eyes of all patients. In addition, the mean CMT and RNFL thickness of the higher hyperopic eyes were significantly higher than that of the fellow eyes. Conclusions: During the process of emmetropization and development of the retina, higher hyperopic eyes in hyperopic patients with anisometropia and amblyopic eyes may have blurred and abnormal vision, leading to under-development of vision, significantly higher CCT, CMT, and RNFL thickness, more hyperopic refraction, and shorter AL in the affected eye.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative roles of the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) in pupillary hippus. METHODS. We used a paired-eye control study design with three cohorts receiving either 1.0% tropicamide (PNS antagonist) in light (TL), 1.0% tropicamide in dark (TD), or 10% phenylephrine (SNS) in light (PL), n = 12 in each. Each subject received one drop to the randomly determined treatment eye, while the other eye served as control. Bilateral measures of pupil size and dynamics were made over 2.6 seconds using an infrared eye-tracker sampling at 500 Hz. Measures were taken at baseline, then every 5 minutes for 40 minutes. Hippus, analyzed in both time and frequency domains, was compared between eyes and cohorts. RESULTS. Pupillary hippus with a distinct dominant frequency was present in all measures at baseline (mean: 0.62 Hz, SD: 0.213 Hz), and that frequency did not change in any group (P = 0.971). Hippus magnitude (treatment eye relative to control eye) decreased in the TL (-72.8 ± 4.7%, P < 0.0001) and TD (-71.3 ± 2.6%, P < 0.0001) groups, but did not change in the PL (+5.4 ± 13.7%, P = 0.173) group, despite PL pupils dilating to a proportion similar to TD. CONCLUSIONS. Pupillary hippus can be extinguished by antagonizing the PNS, whereas agonizing the SNS dilates the pupil without affecting hippus. This suggests that hippus originates from central PNS activity, and not from SNS activity, or oscillations in the balance between PNS and SNS at the pupil. © 2017, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

However, snakes provoked an older and thus stronger evolutionary pressure than spiders, shaping the vision of earliest primates toward preferential visual processing, mainly in the most complex perceptual conditions. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet directly assessed the role of ecologically-relevant stimuli in preferentially accessing visual awareness. Using continuous flash suppression (CFS), the present study assessed the role of evolutionary pressure in gaining a preferential access to visual awareness. For this purpose, we measured the time needed for three types of stimuli - snakes, spiders (matched with snakes for rated fear levels, but for which an influence on humans but not other primates is well grounded) and birds - to break the suppression and enter visual awareness in two different suppression intensity conditions. The results showed that in the less demanding awareness access condition (stimuli presented to the participants' dominant eye) both evolutionarily relevant stimuli (snakes and spiders) showed a faster entry into visual awareness than birds, whereas in the most demanding awareness access condition (stimuli presented to the participants' non-dominant eye) only snakes showed this privileged access. Our data suggest that the privileged unconscious processing of snakes in the most complex perceptual conditions extends to visual awareness, corroborating the proposed influence of snakes in primate visual evolution. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods Seventeen normal subjects, aged 25.0±2.3（mean±SD）were included. The dominant eye was determined using the hole-in-card test. The subjects were induced into four degrees of esophoria angle（0, 2-4, 6-8, 10-12 E）by fitting the base-in prism on non-measurement eye at near vision. The objective refraction and the pupil diameter were measured using WAM-5500. And near binocular visual acuity（NBVA）was measured in each degree of esophoria. We calculated the accommodative lag and in the rate of variability of pupil diameter（VPD）for each degree of esophoria and assessed the relationship between them. Results Difference in the accommodative lag was observed significantly 0E'（0.48±0.54D）and 10-12 E（1.00±0.63D）（p＜0.05）. A correlation was observed between the angle of esophoria and the NBVA（p＜0.01）, and between the accommodative lag and the NBVA（p＜0.01）. There was no correlation between the angle of esophoria and the rate of VPD（p＝0.12）. Conclusions As the degree of divergence amplitude increased, the accommodative lag increased, and the near binocular visual function decreased. These changes may be related to the decreased near binocular visual function during divergence amplitudes. © 2018 Neuro-Ophthalmology Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the role of colour contrast in these behavioural changes. Here, we first show that the changes in eye dominance and contrast sensitivity induced by monocular eye patching affect colour and achromatic contrast sensitivity equally.We next use dichoptic movies, customized and filtered to stimulate the two eyes differentially. We show that a strong imbalance in achromatic contrast between the eyes, with no colour content, also produces similar, unselective shifts in eye dominance for both colour and achromatic contrast sensitivity. Interestingly, if this achromatic imbalance is paired with similar colour contrast in both eyes, the shift in eye dominance is selective, affecting achromatic but not chromatic contrast sensitivity and revealing a dissociation in eye dominance for colour and achromatic image content. On the other hand, a strong imbalance in chromatic contrast between the eyes, with no achromatic content, produces small, unselective changes in eye dominance, but if paired with similar achromatic contrast in both eyes, no changes occur. We conclude that perceptual changes in eye dominance are strongly driven by interocular imbalances in achromatic contrast, with colour contrast having a significant counter balancing effect. In the short term, eyes can have different dominances for achromatic and chromatic contrast, suggesting separate pathways at the site of these neuroplastic changes. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

One fundamental question that remains to be answered is whether invisible own- and other-race faces can nevertheless influence subsequent affective judgments. Here, we employed continuous flash suppression (CFS) to render own- and other-race faces unperceivable in an affective priming task. Both on-line and off-line awareness checks were employed to provide more stringent control of partial awareness. Results revealed that relative to own-race faces, imperceptible other-race faces significantly facilitated participants’ identification of negative words, suggesting an other-race derogation bias. When faces were presented consciously, we found that not only other-race faces facilitated detection of negative words, but also own-race faces facilitated detection of positive words. These findings together provide novel and strong evidence suggesting that invisible racial faces can bias affective responses. © 2016

Methods: This is a prospective contralateral study. Two diffractive multifocal IOLs with different added power were implanted bilaterally in twenty patients. TECNIS® ZKB00 (+ 2.75 D) was implanted in a dominant eye, and TECNIS® ZLB00 (+ 3.25 D) was implanted in a non-dominant eye. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UIVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA), and manifest refraction (MR) values were measured at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. At the 3-month follow-up, defocus curve, contrast sensitivity, and reading performance were evaluated. Quality of vision, overall satisfaction, and spectacle independence were evaluated by questionnaire. Results: Postoperative binocular UDVA, visual acuity at 80 cm, 60 cm, 50 cm, 43 cm, 33 cm were - 0.08 ± 0.10, 0.12 ± 0.14, 0.09 ± 0.09, 0.07 ± 0.11, 0.14 ± 0.09, 0.25 ± 0.11 logMAR. The binocular defocus curve showed an extended range of good visual acuity with sharp vision being observed from 0 D to - 2.50 D defocus (logMAR≤0.1). Reading performance was significantly improved compared to baseline. All patients were spectacle-free at distance, and 94.74% of the patients did not require glasses for near and intermediate vision. Conclusions: Mix-and-match implantation of diffractive multifocal IOLs with different add power provides an excellent wide range of vision, as well as high levels of visual quality and patient satisfaction.

Across 2 experiments, participants performed upper-limb pointing movements to a stationary target or an imperceptibly shifted target under monocular-dominant, monocular-nondominant, and binocular viewing conditions. Under monocular-dominant viewing conditions, participants exhibited better endpoint precision and accuracy. On target jump trials, participants spent more time after peak limb velocity and significantly altered their trajectories toward the new target location only when visual information from the dominant eye was available. Overall, the results suggest that the online visuomotor control processes that typically take place under binocular viewing conditions are significantly influenced by input from the dominant eye. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We show that unconscious BM processing can reflexively direct spatial attention, and that this effect has a biphasic temporal profile. Participants responded to probes that were preceded by intact or scrambled BM cues rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression. With a short inter-stimulus interval (ISI, 100 ms) between the invisible BM cues and the probe, responses to probes at the same location as the invisible, nonpredictive BM cue were faster than to probes at the location of the scrambled BM cue. With a longer ISI (800 ms) this effect reversed, with slower responses to probes at the location of the invisible, nonpredictive BM. These effects were absent when BM and its scrambled control were made visible with both short and long cue durations across variable length of ISIs, indicating that the saliency of BM itself cannot account for the dynamic orienting effects from invisible social cues. Moreover, this dynamic attentional shifts were specific to upright BM cues and not obtained for inverted stimuli. Thus, this reflexive and dynamic attentional modulation triggered by invisible BM, with initial facilitation followed by inhibition, demonstrates that in the complete absence of conscious awareness, cue predictiveness, and saliency differences, attentional systems promote exploration of our visual environment for social signals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Attentional performance is not equal for all eccentric positions, leading to variations in perception. The location of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) for fixation might be influenced by these attentional variations. This study investigated the relation between the placement of sustained attention and the location of a developed PRL using simulations of central scotoma. Thirteen normally sighted subjects participated in the study. Monocular sustained attention was measured in discrete eccentric locations of the visual field using the dominant eye. Subsequently, a six degrees macular scotoma was simulated and PRL training was performed during eight ten-minutes blocks of trials. After training, every subject developed a PRL. Subjects with high attentional capabilities in the lower hemifield generally developed PRLs in the lower hemifield (n = 10), subjects with high attentional capabilities in the upper hemifield developed PRLs in the upper hemifield (n = 2) and one subject with similar attentional capabilities in the upper and lower hemifield developed the PRL on the upper hemifield. Analyzed individually, the results showed that 70% of the subjects had a PRL location in the hemifield where high attentional performance was achieved. These results suggest that attentional capabilities can be used as a predictor for the development of the PRL and are of significance for low vision rehabilitation and for the development of new PRL training procedures, with the option for a preventive attentional training in early macular disease to develop a favorable PRL. © 2017 The Authors

Methods This is a comparative, prospective study in patients with thyroid orbitopathy, conducted at the Conde Ophthalmology Institute in Valenciana, Mexico. The patients included had dysthyroid orbitopathy in the inflammatory phase, and they were treated with subconjunctival injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in the upper eyelid. Five units (group 1) and ten units (group 2) of BTX-A, in a single subconjunctival dose were applied to the non-dominant eye. We evaluated visual acuity, margin-to-reflex distance (RPM1), crease height, ocular motility, diplopia and keratitis, before and after administration of the toxin. The patients were followed at one, 4 and 16 weeks, with the Student t-test as a statistical analysis. Results At week 4, 15 patients (100%) showed a reduced margin to reflex distance. The mean result for group 1 was −1.75 mm (range −1 to −2.5 mm) and group 2 was −2 mm (range −1 to −4 mm). Statistically significant differences were seen between pre-treatment and week 4 in both groups, but no differences between doses. Complete improvement of keratitis and lagophthalmos was observed in 5 and 2 patients, respectively. Visual acuity, ocular motility and crease height did not change in 93% of the patients. One patient (group 1) exhibited complete ptosis and vertical diplopia, which resolved spontaneously at week 6. Conclusion Transconjunctival BTX-A application is safe and effective for the treatment of eyelid retraction in dysthyroid orbitopathy. No difference was found between doses.

We conducted an experiment to discern if maternal and embryonic stressors affect the behavior of hatchlings of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, a species with features that allow for the examination of these stress types in isolation. Separating the impact of stress transmitted through the mother vs. stress experienced by the embryo itself will help clarify the behavioral findings in viviparous species for which it is impossible to disentangle these effects. We also compared the effect of a naturally-occurring (predator cue) and an ""artificial"" (bright, randomly-occurring LED light) embryonic stressor. This allowed us to test the hypothesis that a threat commonly faced by a species (natural threat) would be met with a genetically-programmed and adaptive response while a novel one would confound innate defense mechanisms and lead to maladaptive effects. We found that the maternal stressor was associated with significant differences in body patterning and activity patterns. By contrast, embryonic exposure to stressors increased the proportion of individuals that pursued prey. From these results, it appears that in cuttlefish, maternal and embryonic stressors affect different post-natal behavior in offspring. In addition, the effect of the artificial stressor suggests that organisms can sometimes react adaptively to a stressor even if it is not one that has been encountered during the evolutionary history of the species. © 2017 O'Brien, Jozet-Alves, Mezrai, Bellanger, Darmaillacq and Dickel."

It is natural to wonder whether both eyes contribute equally to the unified cyclopean impression we ordinarily experience. Binocular rivalry, which occurs when the inputs to the two eyes are markedly different, affords a useful means for quantifying the balance of influence exerted by the eyes (called sensory eye dominance, SED) and for relating that degree of balance to other aspects of binocular visual function. However, the precise ways in which binocular rivalry dynamics change when the eyes are unbalanced remain uncharted. Relying on widespread individual variability in the relative predominance of the two eyes as demonstrated in previous studies, we found that an observer's overall tendency to see one eye more than the other was driven both by differences in the relative duration and frequency of instances of that eye's perceptual dominance. Specifically, larger imbalances between the eyes were associated with longer and more frequent periods of exclusive dominance for the stronger eye. Increases in occurrences of dominant eye percepts were mediated in part by a tendency to experience “return transitions” to the predominant eye – that is, observers often experienced sequential exclusive percepts of the dominant eye's image with an intervening mixed percept. Together, these results indicate that the often-observed imbalances between the eyes during binocular rivalry reflect true differences in sensory processing, a finding that has implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying binocular vision in general. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Materials and Methods: Visual field testing used the central (6 × 4) 24 points of the Humphrey Field Analyzer 24-2 program. OCT scans of a corresponding retinal area, centered on the fovea, were divided into a 6 × 4 grid. The thickness of the macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL), ganglion cell layer + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), and mRNFL + GCIPL (GCC) was measured in each grid area. Next, a support vector machine was used to create a MVF prediction model, with training data from 101 eyes of 60 glaucoma patients. Then, the prediction model was validated with data from 108 eyes of 54 glaucoma patients, for MVF and IVF. A simulated IVF was created by merging bilateral simulated MVFs. Results: The overall average of the median 95% prediction interval length for the MVF prediction model (measured in dB) was 10.0, 18.3, and 11.3 for the mRNFL, GCIPL, and GCC, respectively. In the validation data, the overall average root mean squared error (dB) between actual and predicted sensitivity for the IVF was 9.6, 10.5, and 9.5 for the mRNFL, GCIPL, and GCC, respectively, in the 24 grid areas. The intraclass correlation coefficient between average actual and predicted IVF was 0.61, 0.44, and 0.59 in the mRNFL, GCIPL, and GCC, respectively, in the 24 grid areas. Conclusions: We calculated a predicted IVF based on predicted MVFs that were derived, with a new method, from OCT data and validated the accuracy of the calculated IVF. This technique should improve glaucoma management in cases when standard visual field testing is difficult. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

Methods: One hundred MS patients underwent 3.0T brain MRI including gadolinium-enhanced 2D T1-weighted GRE and SE sequences. The two sets of contrast-enhanced scans were evaluated in random fashion by three experienced readers. Lesion conspicuity was assessed by the image contrast ratio (CR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The intracranial region was divided into four quadrants and the impact of lesion location on detection was assessed in each slice. Results: Six hundred and seven gadolinium-enhancing MS lesions were identified. GRE images were more sensitive for lesion detection (0.828) than SE images (0.767). Lesions showed a higher CR in SE than in GRE images, whereas the CNR was higher in GRE than SE. Most misclassifications occurred in the right posterior quadrant. Conclusions: The gadolinium-enhanced 2D T1-weighted GRE sequence at 3.0T MRI enables detection of enhancing MS lesions with higher sensitivity and better lesion conspicuity than 2D T1-weighted SE. Hence, we propose the use of gadolinium-enhanced GRE sequences rather than SE sequences for routine scanning of MS patients at 3.0T. Key Points: • 2D SE and GRE sequences are useful for detecting active MS lesions. • Which of these sequences is more sensitive at high field remains uncertain. • GRE sequence showed better sensitivity for detecting active MS lesions than SE. • We propose GRE sequence for detecting active MS lesions at 3.0T. © 2016, European Society of Radiology.

People with ASD, and those with self-reported sub-threshold autistic traits, also show impairments in rapid visual processing of stimuli unrelated to social or emotional properties. Hence, this study sought to investigate whether perceptually non-conscious visual processing is related to autistic traits. A neurotypical sample of thirty young adults completed the Subthreshold Autism Trait Questionnaire and a Posner-like attention cueing task. Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS) was employed to render incongruous hierarchical arrow cues perceptually invisible prior to consciously presented targets. This was achieved via a 10 Hz masking stimulus presented to the dominant eye that suppressed information presented to the non-dominant eye. Non-conscious arrows consisted of local arrow elements pointing in one direction, and forming a global arrow shape pointing in the opposite direction. On each trial, the cue provided either a valid or invalid cue for the spatial location of the subsequent target, depending on which level (global or local) received privileged attention. A significant autism-trait group by global cue validity interaction indicated a difference in the extent of non-conscious local/global cueing between groups. Simple effect analyses revealed that whilst participants with lower autistic traits showed a global arrow cueing effect, those with higher autistic traits demonstrated a small local arrow cueing effect. These results suggest that non-conscious processing biases in local/global attention may be related to individual differences in autistic traits. © 2017 Laycock, Chan and Crewther.

Material and methods: 15 patients with unilateral superior oblique palsy were enrolled in the study group. Patients were classified according to aetiology as to the group of congenital or acquired palsy. Subjective cyclodeviation was assessed by Harms tangent screen. Objective torsion was measured by means of fundus photography with determination of the disc-foveal angle using Cyclocheck® application. Results: Excyclotropia was discovered in 6 patients with congenital palsy (33%) and 9 individuals with acquired palsy using the Harms tangent screen (89%). Fundus photography revealed excyclotropia in all patients from the study group. The difference between the mean disc-foveal angle in congenital and acquired group was non-significant (p = .316). The objective excyclotropia to vertical deviation and subjective excyclotropia to objective excyclotropia ratios were significantly larger in the acquired group, p = .029 and p = .006 respectively. Conclusions: Measurement of objective ocular torsion by means of Cyclocheck® application is a valuable diagnostic tool in detecting cyclodeviation in patients with superior oblique palsy, especially of congenital aetiology. Presence of excyclotropia on the eye fundus without subjective cyclodeviation measured by the Harms tangent screen indicates congenital aetiology. Results of both tests should be considered taking into account the ocular dominance. © 2018 Oftal Sp. z.o.o.. All rights reserved.
"Irwin D.E.; Robinson M.M.";0.0;How post-saccadic target blanking affects the detection of stimulus displacements across saccades;2018;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2017.09.004;When a visual stimulus is displaced during a saccade the displacement is often not noticed unless it is large compared to the amplitude of the eye movement. Displacement detection is improved, however, if a blank intervenes between saccade target offset and the presentation of the displaced post-saccadic stimulus. This has been interpreted as evidence that precise information about eye position and accurate memory for the position of the pre-saccadic target are available immediately after saccade offset, but are overridden by the presence of the post-saccadic stimulus if it is present when the eyes land. In the current set of experiments we examined in more detail how blanking contributes to the increase in displacement sensitivity. In two experiments we showed that the presentation of a blank interval between saccade offset and the presentation of the displaced stimulus improved people's ability to detect that the stimulus had been displaced and also their ability to judge the direction that it had been displaced, but only for displacements opposite to the direction of the saccade (backward displacements). A third experiment suggested that this improvement in the detection of backward displacements was due in part to subjects misremembering the saccade target location as being closer to the initial fixation point than it actually was immediately after the saccade but remembering its location more veridically 50 ms later. This has the effect of improving the detection of displacements as well as their direction of displacement, but preferentially for backwards vs. forward displacements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

In our research we considered the relation between motor programming and IOR. In an extended replication of an earlier study, using an eye abduction technique we restricted eye movement in the temporal half-space; this resulted in IOR attenuation in that area, compared to the unrestricted, nasal part of the visual field. Our results contradict the earlier result and demonstrate that IOR does depend on preparation of eye movement, as predicted by the oculomotor priming hypothesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

The congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is a common pathology, with low morbidity, but not exempt of complications without the correct diagnosis and management. Methods. Retrospective study from 2005 to 2015 in patients who were submitted to a probing procedure. We identified age at procedure, gender, laterality and presence or absence of success with the procedure. Results. One hundred thirty-seven eyes were analyzed. The median age was 17 months and the total success rate was 85.4%. Conclusion. In congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution with the proper initial conservative management and, in patients older than 12 months, probing has a high rate of success.
"Shanidze N.; Heinen S.; Verghese P.";0.0;Monocular and binocular smooth pursuit in central field loss;2017;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2016.12.013;Macular degeneration results in heterogeneous central field loss (CFL) and often has asymmetrical effects in the two eyes. As such, it is not clear to what degree the movements of the two eyes are coordinated. To address this issue, we examined smooth pursuit quantitatively in CFL participants during binocular viewing and compared it to the monocular viewing case. We also examined coordination of the two eyes during smooth pursuit and how this coordination was affected by interocular ratios of acuity and contrast, as well as CFL-specific interocular differences, such as scotoma sizes and degree of binocular overlap. We hypothesized that the coordination of eye movements would depend on the binocularity of the two eyes. To test our hypotheses, we used a modified step-ramp paradigm, and measured pursuit in both eyes while viewing was binocular, or monocular with the dominant or non-dominant eye. Data for CFL participants and age-matched controls were examined at the group, within-group, and individual levels. We found that CFL participants had a broader range of smooth pursuit gains and a significantly lower correlation between the two eyes, as compared to controls. Across both CFL and control groups, smooth pursuit gain and correlation between the eyes are best predicted by the ratio of contrast sensitivity between the eyes. For the subgroup of participants with measurable stereopsis, both smooth pursuit gain and correlation are best predicted by stereoacuity. Therefore, our results suggest that coordination between the eyes during smooth pursuit depends on binocular cooperation between the eyes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study screened all individuals presenting to two tertiary oculoplastics practices with complaints of ptosis for entry. Primary position photographs were obtained. Ocular dominance was assessed via a modified Porta test. Ptosis was defined in bilateral cases as marginal reflex distance of <2.5 mm in both eyes and in unilateral cases as either an MRD1 < 2.5 mm or MRD1 of >1 mm lower on one side. Asymmetry in brow height was defined as a difference of >1 mm. Chi square and t-tests were performed. Results: Sixty-eight patients from the both tertiary practices met inclusion criteria (37 male, 31 female). Concordance between the higher brow and the dominant side was 50.0% (n = 22, p > 0.05). Mean brow height on the dominant side (15.5 mm) was not statistically different than brow height on the non-dominant side (15.3 mm, p > 0.05). The concordance between the higher brow and the lower MRD1 eyelid was not significant (45.5%, n = 20, p > 0.05). The difference in mean brow height between the lower and higher MRD1 eyes was not significantly different (−0.11 mm; p > 0.05). This also held true when restricted to unilateral cases (0.28; p > 0.05). Conclusions: Although asymmetric brow elevation can be noted in patients with ptosis, ocular dominance does not appear to be concordant with this asymmetry. Additionally, brow height does not appear to be concordant with MRD1 in cases of ptosis. © 2018 Taylor & Francis."

As perceptual experience evolves dynamically under constant external inputs, binocular rivalry has been used for studying intrinsic cortical computations and for understanding how the brain regulates competing inputs. Converging behavioral and EEG results have shown that binocular rivalry and attention are intertwined: binocular rivalry ceases when attention is diverted away from the rivalry stimuli. In addition, the competing image in one eye suppresses the target in the other eye through a pattern of gain changes similar to those induced by attention. These results require a revision of the current computational theories of binocular rivalry, in which the role of attention is ignored. Here, we provide a computational model of binocular rivalry. In the model, competition between two images in rivalry is driven by both attentional modulation and mutual inhibition, which have distinct selectivity (feature vs. eye of origin) and dynamics (relatively slow vs. relatively fast). The proposed model explains a wide range of phenomena reported in rivalry, including the three hallmarks: (i) binocular rivalry requires attention; (ii) various perceptual states emerge when the two images are swapped between the eyes multiple times per second; (iii) the dominance duration as a function of input strength follows Levelt’s propositions. With a bifurcation analysis, we identified the parameter space in which the model’s behavior was consistent with experimental results. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."

In a longitudinal study, infants were tested weekly from 6 to 20 weeks of age. The primary goal of the study was to establish the onset and the early development of sensitivity to uncrossed horizontal disparity. The infant participants were shown dynamic random dot stereograms displaying two squares, one with uncrossed horizontal disparity (0.5°) and one with vertical disparity (0.5°). The stimuli were presented on an autostereoscopic monitor. We used two methods, the forced-choice preferential looking (FPL) method and the classical natural preference (CNP) method, to measure whether the infants preferred the uncrossed over the vertical disparity display. According to the FPL data, the mean relative preferences for horizontal over vertical disparity were significantly greater than chance probability (0.50) from 13 weeks of age onward. With the CNP method we found significant preferences for uncrossed horizontal disparity from 15 weeks onward. The FPL method was hence more sensitive than the CNP method as it indicated an earlier onset of responsiveness to stereoscopic information. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Existing studies suggest that simply averaging the quality of the left and right views well predicts the quality of symmetrically distorted stereoscopic images, but generates substantial prediction bias when applied to asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic images. In this paper, we first build a database that contains both single-view and symmetrically and asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic images. We then carry out a subjective test, where we find that the quality prediction bias of the asymmetrically distorted images could lean toward opposite directions (overestimate or underestimate), depending on the distortion types and levels. Our subjective test also suggests that eye dominance effect does not have strong impact on the visual quality decisions of stereoscopic images. Furthermore, we develop an information content and divisive normalization-based pooling scheme that improves upon structural similarity in estimating the quality of single-view images. Finally, we propose a binocular rivalry-inspired multi-scale model to predict the quality of stereoscopic images from that of the single-view images. Our results show that the proposed model, without explicitly identifying image distortion types, successfully eliminates the prediction bias, leading to significantly improved quality prediction of the stereoscopic images. © 2015 IEEE.

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 58-year-old patient underwent bilateral phacoemulsification with asymmetrical multifocal IOL implantation. Postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) was 0.0 logMAR (20/20 Snellen) and uncorrected near visual acuity was 0.0 logMAR (20/20 Snellen) in both eyes. Quality of vision questionnaire scores for day and night were 5 and 7, respectively. The center of the multifocal IOL in the dominant eye was initially found to be 0.2 mm superotemporally displaced, increasing the percentage area of 'near-add' compared to 'distance-add' within the physiological pupil. Rotation of this IOL 120° clockwise greatly improved the IOL centration within the pupil center and resulted in an immediate improvement in UDVA to -0.1 logMAR (20/16 Snellen) and quality of vision questionnaire scores to 8 and 9, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the centration of an asymmetrical multifocal IOL is important, particularly if there are dysphotoptic or other visual complaints. Copyright © SLACK Incorporated.

While human newborns are capable of detecting the temporal synchrony of visuo-tactile body-related cues, it remains unknown whether they also utilise spatial information for body perception. Twenty newborns were presented with a video of an infant's face touched with a paintbrush, while their own face was touched either in the spatially congruent, or an incongruent, location. We found that newborns show a visual preference for spatially congruent synchronous events, supporting the view that newborns have a rudimentary sense of their own body. © 2015.

Patients and methods: A total of 72 study participants were enrolled in this prospective, cross-sectional study. Participants underwent a comprehensive ocular evaluation, including visual acuity, evaluation of ocular dominance, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure measurement, and optic nerve head and macula analysis using optical coherence tomography and fundus photography. All study participants after initial training underwent MPOD measurement twice in both eyes in a randomized sequence. The repeatability was tested using Altman and Bland plots for first measurements with the second measurements for right eye and left eye and additionally by grouping eyes as a function of ocular dominance. The Pearson correlation coefficient was performed to assess the intereye correlation of MPOD values. Results: The mean age of study participants was 35.5 years (range 22–68 years). The mean MPOD measurements for OD (right eye) and OS (left eye) were 0.47 and 0.48, respectively, which followed a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test, P=0.6 and 0.2). The 95% limits of agreement of Altman and Bland plots for the first and second measurements were −0.12 to +0.11 and −0.13 to +0.12 for OD and OS, respectively. The correlation coefficient of mean MPOD measurements of OD and OS was r statistic =0.94 (Pearson correlation coefficient P<0.0001; r2 0.89). The 95% limits of agreement of Altman and Bland plots when evaluated by laterality of eye or by ocular dominance were narrow, with limits of agreement ranging from −0.13 to +0.12. Conclusion: The MPOD measurements obtained using the QuantifEye show good short-term repeatability. There is excellent intereye correlation, indicating that the MPOD values of one eye data can predict the fellow eye value with 89% accuracy. The ocular dominance had no bearing on the outcome of this psychophysical test in ocular healthy eyes. © 2016 Davey et al."

Although the brain integrates abstract information to compute and compare these values, the only behavioral outcome is often the decision itself. However, if the options are visual stimuli, during deliberation the brain moves the eyes from one stimulus to the other. Previous work suggests that saccade vigor, i.e., peak velocity as a function of amplitude, is greater if reward is associated with the visual stimulus. This raises the possibility that vigor during the free viewing of options may be influenced by the valuation of each option. Here, humans chose between a small, immediate monetary reward and a larger but delayed reward. As the deliberation began, vigor was similar for the saccades made to the two options but diverged 0.5 s before decision time, becoming greater for the preferred option. This difference in vigor increased as a function of the difference in the subjective values that the participant assigned to the delayed and immediate options. After the decision was made, participants continued to gaze at the options, but with reduced vigor, making it possible to infer timing of the decision from the sudden drop in vigor. Therefore, the subjective value that the brain assigned to a stimulus during decision– making affected the motor system via the vigor with which the eyes moved toward that stimulus. © 2015 the authors.

Eye-hand dominance is thought to impact how golfers judge the alignment of the ball with the target and the club with the ball, as well as how golfers visualize the line of the putt when making decisions about the force needed to hit the ball. Previous studies have all measured ocular dominance in primary gaze only, despite golfers spending a significant amount of their time in a putting stance (bent at the hips, head tilted down). Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess ocular dominance in both primary gaze (aligning the ball with the target) and putting gaze (addressing the ball and aligning the club). Methods: This study investigatedmeasuring pointing oculardominance in both primary and putting gaze positions on 31 golfers (14 amateur, 7 club professionals, and 10 top professionals). All playerswere right-handed golfers, although one reported having no hand dominance and one reported being strongly left hand dominant. Results: The results showed that (1) primary and putting gaze ocular dominances are not equal, nor are they predictive of each other; (2) themagnitude of putting ocular dominance is significantly less than themagnitude of primary gaze ocular dominance; (3) ocular dominance is not correlated with handedness in either primary or putting gaze; and (4) eye-hand dominance is not associated with increased putting skill, although ocular dominance may be associated with increased putting success. Conclusions: It is important that coaches assess golfers' ocular dominance in both primary and putting gaze positions to ensure they have the most accurate information upon which to base their vision strategy decisions.

"Mastropasqua T.; Tse P.U.; Turatto M.";0.0;Learning of monocular information facilitates breakthrough to awareness during interocular suppression;2015;Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics;10.3758/s13414-015-0839-z;Continuous flash suppression (CFS) is a potent method of inducing binocular rivalry, wherein a rapid succession of high-contrast images presented to one eye effectively blocks from awareness a low-contrast image presented to the other eye. Here we addressed whether the contents of the suppressed image can break through to awareness with extended CFS exposure. On 2/3 of the trials, we presented a faint bar (the target) to the nondominant eye while a high-contrast flickering Mondrian (the mask) was displayed to the dominant eye. Participants were first asked to report whether the target had broken through the CFS mask. Furthermore, on target-present trials, the participants were then asked to guess whether the target had appeared above or below the fixation point. In Experiment 1, the target was presented with a fixed orientation for four blocks of trials, whereas in the fifth block, the target could also have the orthogonal orientation. In Experiment 2, the target was always presented with a fixed orientation, but in the fifth block, unbeknownst to participants, the target and the mask were swapped across the eyes. We found that awareness of the target rapidly improved with training in both experiments. However, whereas Experiment 1 revealed that the improvement largely generalized across stimulus orientations, Experiment 2 showed that the effect of practice was eye-specific. The results suggest that increased breakthrough with training was due to a monocular form of learning. Finally, a control experiment was conducted to exclude the possibility that the monocular learning we reported could have been due to sensory adaptation caused by the masks. © 2015, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

We investigated anterior EEG alpha-activity asymmetry in response to variable degrees of social contact induced by different gaze directions of a ""live"" model. Neuroticism was negatively related to the anterior EEG asymmetry scores in response to direct gaze, indicating that higher levels of Neuroticism were associated with avoidance-related, relative right-sided functional brain asymmetry. Neuroticism was also related to behavioral direct gaze avoidance and subjective averted gaze preference. These relationships arose primarily from the Withdrawal aspect factor, suggesting that two subdomains of Neuroticism may be differentially related to approach-avoidance tendencies. These findings demonstrate that experimental manipulations of social contact can reveal personality related differences in anterior EEG asymmetry responsiveness, offering a motivationally salient alternative to resting state measures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Methods: Participants were twenty-nine 4-to 8-year-old children with visual impairment and 47 age-matched children with normal vision. After seeing a first symbol (an Lea Hyvärinen [LH] symbol), children were instructed to (1) move the stand magnifier as quickly as possible toward a small target symbol (another LH symbol that could only be seen by using the magnifier), (2) compare the two symbols, and (3) move the magnifier to one of two response areas to indicate whether the two symbols were identical. Performance was measured in terms of accuracy, response time, identification time, and movement time. Viewing distance, as well as hand and eye dominance while using the magnifier was assessed. Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups in accuracy, reaction time, and movement time. Contrary to the prediction, children with visual impairment required less time to identify small symbols than children with normal vision. Both within-subject and between-subject variability in viewing distance were smaller in the visually impaired group than in the normally sighted group. In the visually impaired group, a larger viewing distance was associated with shorter identification time, which in turn was associated with higher accuracy. In the normally sighted group, a faster movement with the magnifier and a faster identification were associated with increasing age. Conclusion: The findings indicate that children with visual impairment can use the stand magnifier adequately and efficiently. The normally sighted children show an age-related development in movement time and identification time and show more variability in viewing distance, which is not found in visually impaired children. Visually impaired children seem to choose a standard but less adaptive strategy in which they primarily used their preferred hand to manipulate the magnifier and their preferred eye to identify the symbol. © 2016 Liebrand-Schurink, Cox, van Rens, Cillessen, Meulenbroek and Boonstra.

We investigated the role of rapid eyemovement sleep in a canonicalmodel of developmental plasticity in vivo (ocular dominance plasticity in the cat) induced by monocular deprivation. Preventing rapid eye movement sleep after monocular deprivation reduced ocular dominance plasticity and inhibited activation of a kinase critical for this plasticity (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Chronic single-neuron recording in freely behaving cats further revealed that cortical activity during rapid eye movement sleep resembled activity present during monocular deprivation. This corresponded to times of maximal extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. These findings indicate that rapid eyemovement sleep promotes molecular and network adaptations that consolidate waking experience in the developing brain. © 2015 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

"Park J.; Park J.";0.0;Exploiting binocular rivalry: Presenting different contents on dominant and non-dominant eyes;2015;Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Workshops, ISMARW 2015;10.1109/ISMARW.2015.14;One of the ergonomic issues of wearing see-though displays is binocular rivalry, which is one of visual perception phenomena. Binocular rivalry happens when different images are rendered to each eye. In this paper, we introduce the potential of making use of binocular rivalry rather than mitigating it when a stereo see-through HMD is worn. We designed experiments where major contents were presented on the dominant eyes and minor contents (e.g., menus) were displayed on the non-dominant eyes. According to preliminary tests, presenting different contents on dominant and non-dominant eyes is feasible if both contents do not overlap, or only one of them is bright. Switching brightness was also helpful in attaining user's attention. By presenting different contents on dominant and non-dominant eyes, users could also observe the real environments more conveniently than presenting a single content on both eyes. © 2015 IEEE.

Methods: The RNFL of 472 glaucoma subjects and of 217 healthy subjects was imaged by an SD-OCT. RNFL defect depth and area on the RNFL map were expressed as an RNFL defect depth percentage index (RDPI) and an RNFL defect area index (RDAI), respectively, according to the following two formulas: 100×[1–{summation of thicknesses of RNFL defects/summation of thicknesses of upper 95th percentile range of age-matched healthy subjects in areas corresponding to defects}]; 100×[number of superpixels of RNFL defects/(46 × 46–superpixels inside optic disc or β zone parapapillary atrophy)]. The best-fitting model describing the relationship between the two parameters was derived by fractional polynomial analysis. Results: Logarithmic fit was determined to be the best-fitting model in describing the relationship of the RDPI against the RDAI (y = 53.4 + 3.7 ln(x) and y = 50.9 + 5.9 ln(x) in superior and inferior hemifields, respectively). The expected RDAIs at the point where the RDPI and RDAI rates of change were the same were 3.7 and 5.9 %; the corresponding upper 95 % confidence interval limits of the RDPI 59.0 and 61.8 % in the superior and inferior hemifields, respectively. Conclusions: The correlation between the RNFL defect depth and area, as derived from the RNFL map, was best described by the logarithmic fit. Changes were more marked in depth than in area, especially for mild localized defects. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
"Borsato F.H.; Morimoto C.H.";0.0;Episcleral surface tracking: Challenges and possibilities for using mice sensors for wearable eye tracking;2016;Eye Tracking Research and Applications Symposium (ETRA);10.1145/2857491.2857496;Video-based eye trackers (VETs) have become the dominant eye tracking technology due to its reasonable cost, accuracy, and easy of use. VETs require real-time image processing to detect and track eye features such as the center of the pupil and corneal reflection to estimate the point of regard. Despite the continuous evolution of cameras and computers that made head mounted eye trackers easier to use in natural activities, real-time processing of high resolution images in mobile devices remains a challenge. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of a novel eye-tracking technique intended for wearable applications that use mice chips as imaging sensors. Such devices are widely available at very low cost, and provide high speed and accurate 2D tracking data. Though mice chips have been used for many purposes other than a computer's pointing device, to our knowledge this is the first attempt to use it as an eye tracker. To validate the technique, we built an episcleral database with about 100 high resolution episcleral patches from 7 individuals. The episclera is the outer most layer of the sclera, which is the white part of the eye, and consists of dense vascular connective tissue. We have used the patches to determine if the episclera contains enough texture to be reliably tracked. We also present results from a prototype built using an off-the-shelf mouse sensor. Our results show that a mouse-based eye tracker has the potential to be very accurate, precise, and fast (measuring 2.1' of visual angle at 1 KHz speed), with little overhead for the wearable computer. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

METHODS: A total of 52 students, 33 males (63.46%) and 19 females (36.54%) from Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, aged 21.18±2.52y included in this study. Subject has normal visual acuity (20/20) and without congenital color vision deficiency (CCVD). They were evaluated by Ishihara Pseudoisochromatic Plate Test (IPPT). Dominant eye (DE) was determined using the Gundogan Method. The CDA was examined by Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test (FM100HT) test for detecting total error score (TES) and local error score (LES) for two eyes (TE) open, the right eye (RE) open and the left eye (LE) open. The error scores were divided into the three groups: for the TE, for the dominant eye (DE) and for the non-dominant eye (NDE). The presence of the binocularity and stereoscopic sensitivity (SS) were investigated by TNO test which were also divided into four groups according to the level of SS within a range of 480-15 arc/s. RESULTS: The error scores of FM100HT without gender difference for TES, blue/yellow (b/y) LES and red/green (r/g) LES were found 61.22±30.32 (58.50), 35.80±19.32 (36.50) and 25.42±14.65 (24.00) respectively. In male subjects (n=31) were found 67.45±29.95 (61.00), 40.25±18.83 (39.00) and 27.19±14.30 (24.00) respectively. In female subjects (n=19) were found 51.05±28.84 (47.00), 25.52±18.32 (28.00) and 22.2±31.13 (23.00) respectively. Females had higher CDA than males according FM100HT error scores. CDA classification according to FM100HT were found to be higher (6%, TES=0-20), medium (86%, TES=20-100), lower (8%, TES>100), the medium level was statistically more frequently observed (P<0.05). The r/g color LES for DE and NDE were 24.12±14.70 and 32.20±14.21, b/y color LES for DE and NDE were 34.68±1.95 and 36.24±17.56 respectively. In female (n=19) r/g color LES for DE and NDE were 21.89±15.06 and 31.00±22.42; in male (n=31) 25.48±14.55 and 32.93±17.31. In female (n=19) b/y color LES for DE and NDE were 29.63±18.62 and 33.42±17.38; in male (n=31) 37.77±18.78 and 37.96±17.73 respectively. All students' TES of TE, DE and NDE subgroups and stereopsis level of were compared, the differences were not statistically significant (P=1). According to our research CDA and binocular depth perception does not effect on each other. CONCLUSION: In normal subjects TES of FM100HT showed that no difference in the subject with different stereopsis level and the depth perception evaluated by TNO test which is based on color dissociation and the ability to color discrimination was not correlated. Our previous study DE's CDA was found superior to the NDE's. But in the presenting study showed that DE was not superior to NDE in terms of depth perception. Copyright 2016 by the IJO Press."

Do humans with uncorrected anisometropia who have not developed anisometropic amblyopia exhibit a shift in ocular dominance nonetheless, reflecting a more subtle form of deprivation? Also, is such a change in dominance, if it occurs, permanent or could it be rectified by an extended period of optical correction? Methods. A total of 25 normal controls (27.5 ± 2.1 years; mean ± SD); 28 anisometropes (20.7 ± 5.6 years) who were fully corrected for more than 16 weeks prior to this investigation; and 24 anisometropes who had never been corrected (21.2 ± 9.8 years) participated in this study. Sensory eye dominance of observers was measured using the binocular phase combination paradigm to find an interocular contrast ratio at which the contributions of each eye to the binocularly fused percept were equal (i.e., the balance point measure of ocular dominance). Results. Controls exhibited a balance point close to unity (0.91 ± 0.05), while the two groups of anisometropes exhibited a clear binocular imbalance (uncorrected anisometropes, 0.51 ± 0.28; corrected anisometropes, 0.70 ± 0.19); both were significantly different from controls (P < 0.001). The imbalance was less severe in corrected anisometropes compared with uncorrected anisometropes (P = 0.004). Conclusions. We find that anisometropia is associated with an ocular imbalance even in the absence of amblyopia. This abnormality is weaker in anisometropes who have worn an optical correction for some time, suggestive that a better optical status leads to a better binocular status. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

The cursor movements and a selection were indicated by eye movements or a voluntary eye blink. In preliminary experiments, the characteristics of eight directional eye movements were examined for user-friendly input operation. Six operations of down, left, right, lower left, lower right, and voluntary eye wink were assumed to be eye movements considering the accuracy of the input operations and the influence of the involuntary blink. Moreover, a hierarchical screen keyboard was proposed to improve the performance of the input interface even if the number of the operations was limited. © 2015 Pushpa Publishing House.

Many neurotrophic factors are also expressed in adult brain, where they regulate neuronal connectivity and network plasticity. Neurotrophic factors are typically released from the target cells or postsynaptic neurons, taken up by the presynaptic axon terminals and retrogradely transported to the soma. Access of the axon terminal to neurotrophic factors selects among excessively generated neurons or neuronal processes for survival those that have established an optimal connection with the target cell, whereas neurons or processes with an insufficient access or transport of neurotrophic factors degenerate. Therefore, the primary function of neurotrophic factors is to mediate information to the neuronal soma about the quality of the connection between a neuron and its target. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013 and Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.

METHODS: Consecutive hyperopic patients who underwent presbyopic LASIK between September 2013 and July 2014 were included. For the non-dominant eyes, the aspheric ablation profile associated with a myopic refraction was planned using the Custom-Q nomogram (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA), spherical equivalent refraction, δQ, and change in corneal spherical aberration coefficient (δC4 0) were analyzed. Postoperative data were collected at 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included. The mean age was 56.5 ± 5.7 years (range: 47 to 70 years). At the 6-month follow-up, the spherical equivalent refraction for non-dominant and dominant eyes was -1.07 ± 0.74 and 0.32 ± 0.55 diopters (D), respectively. The mean binocular UDVA was 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR (range: -0.12 to 0.30 logMAR); 91% of patients achieved 20/20 or better binocular UDVA and 83% of patients had Jaeger 3 (Parinaud 4) or better binocular UNVA. The δQ for non-dominant and dominant eyes was -0.61 ± 0.15 and -0.33 ± 0.25, respectively, for a 6-mm pupil diameter and was significantly higher for non-dominant eyes (P < .0001). The achieved δC4 0 was -0.49 ± 0.23 μm for non-dominant eyes (for a theoretical ideal value of -0.40 μm) and -0.30 ± 0.18 μm for dominant eyes. For non-dominant eyes, the attempted δQ (-0.60) was close to the achieved value (-0.61 ± 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: For hyperopic patients, combining the customized corneal aspheric ablation profile with monovision is safe, effective, and reproducible, inducing intended changes in corneal spherical aberrations.

Objective: To assess the influence of homogeneous training, years of experience, and eye dominance on the percentage of correctness, sensitivity, and specificity of ASIS evaluation. Methods: Osteopathic physicians, predoctoral teaching fellows, and first- and secondyear osteopathic medical students from a single teaching institute assessed 3 plastic pelvic models with ASIS anatomic landmarks set at different levels: even and 5- and 10-mm descrepancies. Dominant and nondominant eyes were used independently to assess ASIS levels. Results: A total of 147 examiners (participantss) participated in this study (66 firstyear and 61 second-year medical students, 15 fellows, and 5 osteopathic physicians). The overall percentages of correct results were 31.0% (even levels), 82.8% (5-mm discrepancy), and 91.7% (10-mm discrepancy). Differences by level of training were statistically significant only for the 5-mm ASIS discrepancy, where participants with more experience performed better. The overall sensitivity was 82.8% (5-mm discrepancy) and 91.7% (10-mm discrepancy), and the specificity was 31.0%. No statistically significant differences were found in the percentage of correct results by eye dominance. Conclusion: Assessment of ASIS is sensitive but not specific at discrepancies of 5 mm or greater. Length of experience positively influences the percentage of correct results, and eye dominance does not significantly change this outcome. This form of assessment can be used to screen for ASIS asymmetry. © 2015 American Osteopathic Association.

Design: A cross-sectional study at a university eye clinic. Participants: Twenty-three subjects were recruited in each group, for a total of 46 patients. Methods: CCT was measured using an ultrasound pachymeter in each subject. Three consecutive measurements in each eye were first taken in the sitting position, and repeated after 10 min and 30 min in a supine position. Results were analyzed using mixed model repeated measures, which adjusted for age, gender and laterality of eyes. Main Outcome Measures: CCT. Results: In healthy subjects, CCT decreased with supine positioning at 10 min (mean = −5.2 µm, P = 0.0043) and at 30 min (mean = −6.5 µm, P < 0.0001). In the glaucoma group, CCT decreased with supine positioning at 10 min (mean = −6.7 µm, P = 0.0043) and at 30 min (mean = −10.2 µm, P < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the CCT at 10 min supine and at 30 min supine in the healthy subjects (P = 0.37) and glaucoma patients (P = 0.14). CCT was shown to decrease linearly over time (P < 0.0001), and the slopes were not statistically different between groups (P = 0.40). Conclusions: CCT is a dynamic measurement that can be influenced by body position. It decreases linearly in the first 30 min of supine positioning at a similar rate in both open angle glaucoma patients and in healthy subjects. © 2016 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists

However, it is still unclear whether sensory dominance also implies the generation of a greater state of arousal. Here, we assess the psycho-physiological reactions to different materials when presented tactually (Group 1) or visually (Group 2). In Group 1, the participants’ forearm was stroked with different textures (satin, tinfoil, leather, sandpaper and abrasive sponge), by either a male or a female experimenter. The speed of stimulation was set to elicit a vigorous response of C-tactile afferents, involved in the perception of the more pleasant aspects of touch. The participants were asked to rate the pleasantness of the stimulation. In Group 2, the same textures were presented only visually, and the participants were asked to rate the imagined pleasantness of being touched by those stimuli. Skin conductance responses were recorded in both groups. The results revealed that the tactile presentation of the stimuli led to higher skin conductance responses than the visual presentation; this difference was higher for women than for men. Smooth materials were perceived as more pleasant than rough materials, but no differences in terms of skin conductance responses were found among them. Moreover, the textures were rated as less pleasant when presented visually than when presented tactually. These findings are relevant to understand how physiological arousal is modulated by different senses and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in hedonic tactile perception. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

As a noninvasive test it’s particularly useful in children, but its applicability is limited by the existence of normative values for adults only. Purpose: To establish the pediatric normative values of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular thickness and to investigate its relationship with sex, age, refraction, eye side and ocular dominance. Material and Methods: Ophthalmologic examination and Cirrus HD-optical coherence tomography (Carl Zeiss Meditec) were carried out on 153 children aged 4 to 17 years old. Results: We obtained a mean retinal nerve fiber layer average thickness of 97.90 μm. No significant differences were detected between genders, however the eye side and ocular dominance had significant influence on retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness increased significantly with more positive refraction. With the Macular Cube 512 x 128 protocol we found that the average central subfield showed the smallest thickness (250.35 μm) and boys had higher macular thickness. Discussion: The values of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular thickness obtained are comparable to recent studies. The distribution of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in quadrants is in agreement with the normal distribution of retinal nerve fiber layer. Macular thickness proved to be higher in males (center field and inner ring), data consistent with previous studies. Conclusion: We establish the normative retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular thickness in healthy Portuguese children. These data enhance the evaluation and interpretation of parameters obtained by optical coherence tomography in the diagnosis of pediatric disorders in clinical practice. © Ordem dos Médicos 2015.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements, which are responsible for accurately keeping moving objects on the fovea, is delayed in people with anisometropic amblyopia. Methods: Eleven participants with anisometropic amblyopia and 14 visually normal observers were asked to track a step-ramp target moving at ±15°/s horizontally as quickly and as accurately as possible. The experiment was conducted under three viewing conditions: amblyopic/nondominant eye, binocular, and fellow/dominant eye viewing. Outcome measures were smooth pursuit latency, open-loop gain, steady state gain, and catch-up saccade frequency. Results: Participants with anisometropic amblyopia initiated smooth pursuit significantly slower during amblyopic eye viewing (206 ± 20 ms) than visually normal observers viewing with their nondominant eye (183 ± 17 ms, P = 0.002). However, mean pursuit latency in the anisometropic amblyopia group during binocular and monocular fellow eye viewing was comparable to the visually normal group. Mean open-loop gain, steady state gain, and catch-up saccade frequency were similar between the two groups, but participants with anisometropic amblyopia exhibited more variable steady state gain (P = 0.045). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of temporally delayed smooth pursuit initiation in anisometropic amblyopia. After initiation, the smooth pursuit velocity profile in anisometropic amblyopia participants is similar to visually normal controls. This finding differs from what has been observed previously in participants with strabismic amblyopia who exhibit reduced smooth pursuit velocity gains with more catch-up saccades. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

Here we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of conditions of increasing social scene complexity using 3D human models as targets of attention, which may also be important in autism research. Challenging single-trial statistical classification of EEG neural signals was attempted for detection of oddball stimuli with increasing social scene complexity. Stimuli had an oddball structure and were as follows: 1) flashed schematic eyes, 2) simple 3D faces flashed between averted and non-averted gaze (only eye position changing), 3) simple 3D faces flashed between averted and non-averted gaze (head and eye position changing), 4) animated avatar alternated its gaze direction to the left and to the right (head and eye position), 5) environment with 4 animated avatars all of which change gaze and one of which is the target of attention. We found a late (> 300 ms) neurophysiological oddball correlate for all conditions irrespective of their complexity as assessed by repeated measures ANOVA. We attempted single-trial detection of this signal with automatic classifiers and obtained a significant balanced accuracy classification of around 79%, which is noteworthy given the amount of scene complexity. Lateralization analysis showed a specific right lateralization only for more complex realistic social scenes. In sum, complex ecological animations with social content elicit neurophysiological events which can be characterized even at the single-trial level. These signals are right lateralized. These finding paves the way for neuroscientific studies in affective neuroscience based on complex social scenes, and given the detectability at the single trial level this suggests the feasibility of brain computer interfaces that can be applied to social cognition disorders such as autism. © 2015 Amaral et al.

While several techniques have been proposed, most of them are focused on the use of Web usage logs. Only recently has the use of data from users[U+05F3] biological responses emerged as an alternative to enrich the analysis. In this work, a model is proposed to identify Website Key Objects that not only takes into account visual gaze activity, such as fixation time, but also the impact of pupil dilation. Our main hypothesis is that there is a strong relationship in terms of the pupil dynamics and the Web user preferences on a Web page. An empirical study was conducted on a real Website, from which the navigational activity of 23 subjects was captured using an eye tracking device. Results showed that the inclusion of pupillary activity, although not conclusively, allows us to extract a more robust Web Object classification, achieving a 14% increment in the overall accuracy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

Method: Six subjects were recruited for a prospective study. Up to 32 measurements by ORA were performed in series on the dominant eye of each subject. A relationship was examined between Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure values (IOPg) obtained from the standard ORA output and IOPg′ calculated from raw ORA data with a custom-written procedure. The same analysis was carried out for the parameters of corneal hysteresis (CH and CH′). Data and statistical analysis included Epanechnikov kernel smoothing, orthogonal linear regression, hypothesis testing and bootstrap techniques. Results: The group average (mean ± standard deviation) IOPg and CH values were 11.6 ± 1.8mmHg and 10.7 ± 1.7mmHg, respectively. A strong correlation was found between IOPg and IOPg′ and also between CH and CH′ parameters. There was a significant (Behrens-Fisher test, p < 0.001) difference between subjects for both IOPg and CH calculations, in terms of the regression slope parameter. Conclusions: Subject-related variations of ORA parameter calculation were demonstrated. This could indicate that currently employed estimators of IOP parameters include unreported algorithmic procedures that may lead to biased results. © 2015 Optometry Australia.
"Lin S.-Y.; Yeh S.-L.";0.0;Interocular grouping without awareness;2016;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2016.01.004;Interocular grouping occurs when different parts of an image presented to each eye bound into a coherent whole. Previous studies anticipated that these parts are visible to both eyes simultaneously (i.e., the images altered back and forth). Although this view is consistent with the general consensus of binocular rivalry (BR) that suppressed stimuli receive no processing beyond rudimentary level (i.e., adaptation), it is actually inconsistent with studies that use continuous flash suppression (CFS). CFS is a form of interocular suppression that is more stable and causes stronger suppression of stimuli than BR. In the present study, we examined whether or not interocular grouping needs to occur at a conscious level as prior studies suggested. The modified double-rectangle paradigm used by Egly, Driver, and Rafal (1994) was adopted, and object-based attention was directed for successful grouping. To induce interocular grouping, we presented complementary parts of two rectangles dichoptically for possible interocular grouping and a dynamic Mondrian in front of one eye (i.e., CFS). Two concurrent targets were presented after one of the visible parts of the rectangles was cued. Participants were asked to judge which target appeared first. We found that the target showed on the cued rectangle after interocular grouping was reported to appear first more frequently than the target on the uncued rectangle. This result was based on the majority of trials where the suppressed parts of the objects remained invisible, which indicates that interocular grouping can occur without all the to-be-grouped parts being visible and without awareness. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, efficient rendering methods that can process massive stereo data on those devices are becoming more important as well as reducing a feeling of visual discomfort of the viewer. In this paper, we analyze binocular suppression in an aspect of human visual perception, and present a point-based stereo rendering method to process high-resolution 3D data based on binocular suppression. To reduce visual discomfort which occurs in the process of the stereo rendering, we develop a simplification method by extending spectral sampling. Using the adaptive sampling, we can improve the rendering quality, especially in the visually sensitive areas as well as reducing the size of datasets. © 2015 IEEE.

Great number of vision tests used to assess the visual skills and it will be irrational to perform all vision tests for every sport. Objectives: The purpose of this protocol article is to present a relatively comprehensive battery of tests and assessments on static and dynamic aspects of sight which seems relevant to sports vision and introduce the most useful ones for archery. Materials and Methods: Through extensive review of the literature, visual skills and respective tests were listed; such as ‘visual acuity, ‘contrast sensitivity’, ‘stereo-acuity’, ‘ocular alignment’, and ‘eye dominance’. Athletes were defined as “elite” and “non-elite” category based on their past performance. Dominance was considered for eye and hand; binocular or monocular aiming was planned to be recorded. Illumination condition was defined as to simulate the real archery condition to the extent possible. The full cycle of examinations and their order for each athlete was sketched (and estimated to take 40 minutes). Protocol was piloted in an eye hospital. Female and male archers aged 18 - 38 years who practiced compound and recurve archery with a history of more than 6 months were included. Conclusions: We managed to select and design a customized examination protocol for archery (a sight-intensive and aiming type of sports), serving skill assessment and research purposes. Our definition for elite and non-elite athletes can help to define sports talent and devise skill development methods as we compare the performance of these two groups. In our pilot, we identified 8 “archery figures” (by hand dominance, eye dominance and binocularity) and highlighted the concept “congruence” (dominant hand and eye in the same side) in archery performance. © 2016, Sports Medicine Research Center."

Monitoring and intercepting a fast approaching object is a critical skill for many sports. Athletes might be distinguished from nonathletes based on their ability to access various visual abilities to accomplish interceptive actions. Here, we examined whether interceptive visuomotor skills of athletes and nonathletes are differently correlated to a hierarchy of visuo-oculomotor abilities related to the perception of motion in depth. Methods. Eighty-six athletes in interceptive sports, as well as 60 nonathletes, were recruited based on their sport performance and prior experiences. Their basic visual abilities (dominant eye acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual span, and visual memory) and complex visuo-oculomotor abilities (dynamic acuity, accommodative facility, near point of convergence, and near/far phoria) were analyzed in relation to critical visuomotor skills (manual interception, visually guided locomotion, and depth judgment). Results. Discriminant analysis revealed that athletes and nonathletes can be accurately differentiated based on measured visuomotor skills (91.3% accuracy, p < 0.0001). Near point of convergence, accommodative facility, and dynamic acuity were moderately effective in identifying athletes (71.3%, p = 0.002) and in predicting the three visuomotor skills (all r2 ≥ 0.096, all p ≤ 0.022). Dominant eye acuity and contrast sensitivity also identified athletes (61.4%, p = 0.021) and contributed to complex visuo-oculomotor abilities (all r2 ≥ 0.046, all p ≤ 0.039). The correlations among measured abilities were more significant for athletes than nonathletes. Conclusions. Athletes in interceptive sports are superior to nonathletes in their visuomotor skills. They also have broader access to various visual and complex visuo-oculomotor abilities than nonathletes. This likely allows athletes to more effectively coordinate visual and oculomotor abilities under demanding conditions when some visual cues are degraded. The present findings are consistent with a pyramid of sports vision and suggest a top-down process for athlete screening and training. Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Optometry.

Methods A double-masked randomized crossover trial of Air Optix Aqua multifocal, PureVision 2 for Presbyopia, Acuvue OASYS for Presbyopia, Biofinity multifocal, and monovision with Biofinity contact lenses was conducted on 35 presbyopes (54.3 ± 6.2 years). After 4 weeks of wear, visual performance was quantified by high-and low-contrast visual acuity under photopic and mesopic conditions, reading speed, defocus curves, stereopsis, halometry, aberrometry, Near Activity Visual Questionnaire rating, and infjective quality of vision scoring. Bulbar, limbal, and palpebral hyperemia and corneal staining were graded to monitor the impact of each contact lens on ocular physiology. Results High-contrast photopic visual acuity (p = 0.102), reading speed (F = 1.082, p = 0.368), and aberrometry (F = 0.855, p = 0.493) were not significantly different between presbyopic lens options. Defocus curve profiles (p < 0.001), stereopsis (p < 0.001), halometry (F = 4.101, p = 0.004), Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (F = 3.730, p = 0.007), quality of vision (p = 0.002), bulbar hyperemia (p = 0.020), and palpebral hyperemia (p = 0.012) differed significantly between lens types, with the Biofinity multifocal lens design principal (center-distance lens was fitted to the dominant eye and a center-near lens to the nondominant eye) typically outperforming the other lenses. Conclusions Although ocular aberration variation between individuals largely masks the differences in optics between current multifocal contact lens designs, certain design strategies can outperform monovision, even in early presbyopes. © 2015 American Academy of Optometry.

The current study investigated which infant characteristics play a role in dropout. Infants were presented with a preferential looking task at 6 and 9 months of age. At 9 months of age, an additional habituation task and a subsequent novelty preference task were conducted. In addition, temperament was assessed via the Infant Behavior Questionnaire - Revised (IBQ-R, Gartstein & Rothbart, 2003), and cognitive developmental status was assessed via the Cognitive Scale of the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III, Bayley, 2006). Dropout was positively related to the IBQ-R temperament scales Distress to Limitations and Approach, and negatively related to the scales Falling Reactivity and Cuddliness. The representativeness of the final sample regarding situation-specific temperament dimensions is affected by dropout. Dropout was not related to cognitive developmental status as measured via the BSID-III, habituation speed and novelty preference. Dropout at 6 months of age was associated with dropout at 9 months of age. We concluded that in looking time studies, the representativeness of the final sample regarding performance-relevant temperament dimensions or cognitive developmental status is not affected by dropout. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Low-level image properties, scene visual saliency, and eye movements were controlled. Results showed that (a) correct identification of the emotional scene exceeded the chance level; (b) performance was more accurate and faster when the emotional scene appeared in the left than in the right visual field; (c) lateralization was equivalent for females and males for pleasant scenes, but was greater for females and unpleasant scenes; and (d) lateralization occurred similarly for different emotional scene categories. These findings reveal discrimination between emotional and neutral scenes, and right brain hemisphere dominance for emotional processing, which is modulated by sex of the viewer and scene valence, and suggest that coarse affective significance can be extracted in peripheral vision. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The question is raised as to whether rigidity in PD also extends to perception, and if so, whether perceptual, cognitive, and personality rigidities are correlated. Bistable stimuli were presented to 28 non-demented individuals with PD and 26 normal control adults (NC). Necker cube perception and binocular rivalry were examined during passive viewing, and the Necker cube was additionally used for two volitional-control conditions: Hold one percept in front, and Switch between the two percepts. Relative to passive viewing, PD were significantly less able than NC to reduce dominance durations in the Switch condition, indicating perceptual rigidity. Tests of cognitive flexibility and a personality questionnaire were administered to explore the association with perceptual rigidity. Cognitive flexibility was not correlated with perceptual rigidity for either group. Personality (novelty seeking) correlated with dominance durations on Necker passive viewing for PD but not NC. The results indicate the presence in mild-moderate PD of perceptual rigidity and suggest shared neural substrates with novelty seeking, but functional divergence from those supporting cognitive flexibility. The possibility is raised that perceptual rigidity may be a harbinger of cognitive inflexibility later in the disease course. © 2015.

Setting Cathedral Eye Clinic, Belfast, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. Design Retrospective comparative case series. Methods The study enrolled consecutive patients having refractive lens exchange and implantation of rotationally asymmetric multifocal IOLs. Group 1 received bilateral SBL-3 IOLs and Group 2 received bilateral Lentis Mplus LS-312 MF30 IOLs, with the near segments placed inferonasally in each group. Group 3 received a Lentis Mplus LS-312 MF20 IOL in the dominant eye with the near segment positioned superotemporal and a Lenstec SBL-3 IOL positioned inferonasally in the fellow eye. Binocular uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuities, binocular uncorrected near (UNVA) and intermediate (UIVA) visual acuities, binocular distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuities, and quality of vision were evaluated over 3 months postoperatively. Results The study enrolled 180 patients (360 eyes). There was no significant difference between the groups in binocular UDVA, UIVA, and UNVA; however, there was a significant difference between the groups in quality of vision (P ≤ .001). Group 3 had significantly better overall quality of vision. Conclusion When implanting rotationally asymmetric multifocal IOLs, a combination of superotemporal placement of the near segment (+2.00 diopter [D] addition [add]) in the dominant eye with inferonasal placement of the near segment (+3.00 D add) in the fellow eye yielded consistent, high overall quality of vision and uncorrected visual acuity.

All other vertebrates lack this structure and hence interocular information exchange is more restricted, raising issues of how information acquired with each eye contributes to the control of behaviour. Studies of food hoarding, laboratory-based discrimination tasks and homing in birds show that information acquired with one eye is not immediately available for action guided by the opposite one. We investigated interocular transfer, using filial imprinting in pekin ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos domestica, as our experimental system. In experiment 1 we imprinted hatchlings on either of two duck decoys, in three treatments differing on whether (A) birds were trained and later tested for a following response binocularly, (B) trained and tested monocularly, with the same eye, or (C) trained and tested monocularly, with opposite eyes. Birds preferred the training decoy for at least 3 h after imprinting in treatments A and B, but were indifferent in C. In experiment 2 birds were imprinted sequentially with two decoys, in three treatments where they were (D) trained and tested binocularly, (E) trained monocularly with a different decoy for each eye and tested monocularly with each eye, or (F) trained monocularly with a different decoy for each eye and tested binocularly. In treatment D ducklings were close to indifference, with a weak preference for the most recent decoy. In treatment E preference weakly favoured the decoy used during imprinting with the eye being tested. Finally, in treatment F there was no evidence for dominance of either eye. Thus, imprinting information is laterally isolated for at least 3 h, the experience status of the opposite eye (naïve or with a competing imprinting) has a small effect and we found no evidence for eye dominance. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

Here we investigate the color preferences of dichromats. We aim (i) to establish whether the systematic and reliable color preferences of normal trichromatic observers (e.g., preference maximum at blue, minimum at yellow-green) are affected by dichromacy and (ii) to test theories of color preference with a dichromatic sample. Dichromat and normal trichromat observers named and rated how much they liked saturated, light, dark, and focal colors twice. Trichromats had the expected pattern of preference. Dichromats had a reliable pattern of preference that was different to trichromats, with a preference maximum rather than minimum at yellow and a much weaker preference for blue than trichromats. Color preference was more affected in observers who lacked the cone type sensitive to long wavelengths (protanopes) than in those who lacked the cone type sensitive to medium wavelengths (deuteranopes). Trichromats' preferences were summarized effectively in terms of cone-contrast between color and background, and yellow-blue cone-contrast could account for dichromats' pattern of preference, with some evidence for residual red-green activity in deuteranopes' preference. Dichromats' color naming also could account for their color preferences, with colors named more accurately and quickly being more preferred. This relationship between color naming and preference also was present for trichromat males but not females. Overall, the findings provide novel evidence on how dichromats experience color, advance the understanding of why humans like some colors more than others, and have implications for general theories of aesthetics.
"Cheng S.; Peng Q.; Shi B.E.";0.0;A two layer disparity selective simple cell model;2016;Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks;10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727825;The responses of disparity selective complex cells in the mammalian visual system are often modeled by the disparity energy model. This model linearly combines inputs from binocular simple cell units, whose responses are computed by the combination of left and right eye inputs through linear binocular receptive fields, followed by half wave rectification and an expansive nonlinearity. While many complex cells have responses that can be modeled by the standard disparity energy model, there are many that cannot be. While the standard disparity energy model has been extended to account for some specific types of tuning (e.g. cells that are 'monocularly responsive' in that they only respond to input from one eye, yet are disparity tuned indicating that they receive input from both eyes), actual neurons display a wider range of ocular dominance indices and disparity selectivities than can be fully accounted for by these models. Here, we describe a two layer simple cell model that can be used to construct complex cells that fully cover this range. The model combines the responses from a first layer of model monocular simple cells. By adjusting the weights from the monocular to a second binocular layer, the model can exhibit more diverse tuning properties than previously proposed models. We also show that these weights can be learned by sparse coding, and that if so, there is a strong relationship between distribution of tuning properties in the population and the input disparity statistics. © 2016 IEEE.

We investigated the association between ocular dominance (sighting dominance) and refractive asymmetry in patients with hyperopia. Methods: This retrospective study included 223 hyperopic patients with a mean age of 10.1 ± 3.6 years (range 3 to 21 years). Refractive error was measured with cycloplegic refraction, and axial length was measured with IOLMaster® (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Ocular dominance was assessed with the hole- in- the- card test. The amount of hyperopic anisometropia was subdivided into four groups: less than 0.50 D, 0.50- 0.99 D, 1.00- 1.99 D, and 2.00 D or greater. Results: Ocular dominance of the right and left eye was seen in 66% and 34% of the patients, respectively. The nondominant eye had higher hyperopia, astigmatism, and shorter axial length than the dominant eye (P < 0.001). In the group with spherical equivalent anisometropia of =0.50 D in particular, the nondominant eye was significantly more hyperopic and had shorter axial length than the dominant eye (both P < 0.001). Conclusions: The current study revealed that the nondominant eye had a greater hyperopic refractive error and shorter axial length than the dominant eye, in patients who had a high degree of anisometropia in particular.

A core assumption of this model is that the two visual streams are differentially involved in visual awareness: ventral stream processing is closely linked to awareness while dorsal stream processing is not. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with human observers, we directly probed the stimulus-related information encoded in fMRI response patterns in both visual streams as a function of stimulus visibility. We parametrically modulated the visibility of face and tool stimuli by varying the contrasts of the masks in a continuous flash suppression (CFS) paradigm. We found that visibility – operationalized by objective and subjective measures – decreased proportionally with increasing log CFS mask contrast. Neuronally, this relationship was closely matched by ventral visual areas, showing a linear decrease of stimulus-related information with increasing mask contrast. Stimulus-related information in dorsal areas also showed a dependency on mask contrast, but the decrease rather followed a step function instead of a linear function. Together, our results suggest that both the ventral and the dorsal visual stream are linked to visual awareness, but neural activity in ventral areas more closely reflects graded differences in awareness compared to dorsal areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

Methods: Monocular and binocular VF measurements were evaluated using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA; 24-2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm standard program) in 60 eyes of 30 patients with open angle glaucoma. Ocular dominance was measured twice in each patient and the average value was used. Measured binocular sensitivity was then predicted based on monocular measurements using the “better sensitivity” integrated visual field (IVF) method, monocular sensitivity summation methods on the dB scale, linear scale (1/Lambert), and finally monocular sensitivity summation methods on the linear scale adjusted for the ocular dominance. Results: The absolute prediction error with the linear scale summation method (mean ± SD: 3.11 ± 4.00) was significantly smaller than the IVF method (3.15 ± 4.09; P = 0.014). Further, the absolute prediction error for the ocular dominance adjusted method (3.10 ± 3.99) was significantly smaller than the nonadjusted linear scale summation method (P = 0.014). The absolute prediction error associated with the dB scale summation method was significantly larger than any other method (8.15 ± 5.06; P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The most accurate estimation of binocular sensitivity was achieved using the linear monocular sensitivity summation model adjusted for ocular dominance. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

We assessed whether partial occlusion of the nonamblyopic eye with Bangerter filters can immediately reduce suppression and promote binocular summation of contrast in observers with amblyopia.; METHODS. In Experiment 1, suppression was measured for 22 observers (mean age, 20 years; range, 14–32 years; 10 females) with strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia and 10 controls using our previously established “balance point” protocol. Measurements were made at baseline and with 0.6-, 0.4-, and 0.2-strength Bangerter filters placed over the nonamblyopic/ dominant eye. In Experiment 2, psychophysical measurements of contrast sensitivity were made under binocular and monocular viewing conditions for 25 observers with anisometropic amblyopia (mean age, 17 years; range, 11–28 years; 14 females) and 22 controls (mean age, 24 years; range, 22–27; 12 female). Measurements were made at baseline, and with 0.4- and 0.2-strength Bangerter filters placed over the nonamblyopic/dominant eye. Binocular summation ratios (BSRs) were calculated at baseline and with Bangerter filters in place.; RESULTS. Experiment 1: Bangerter filters reduced suppression in observers with amblyopia and induced suppression in controls (P = 0.025). The 0.2-strength filter eliminated suppression in observers with amblyopia and this was not a visual acuity effect. Experiment 2: Bangerter filters were able to induce normal levels of binocular contrast summation in the group of observers with anisometropic amblyopia for a stimulus with a spatial frequency of 3 cycles per degree (cpd, P = 0.006). The filters reduced binocular summation in controls.; CONCLUSIONS. Bangerter filters can immediately reduce suppression and promote binocular summation for mid/low spatial frequencies in observers with amblyopia. © 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."
Huber D.E.;0.0;Using continual flash suppression to investigate cognitive aftereffects;2015;Consciousness and Cognition;10.1016/j.concog.2015.04.017;In a naming task with visually presented words, Prioli and Kahan (in press) reported that negatively valenced words were identified more slowly than neutral words in a condition with continual flash suppression (CFS), which involves showing the dominant eye changing Mondrian patterns, delaying awareness for the word shown to the other eye. However, when these same words were shown to both eyes (i.e., no CFS), negatively valenced words were identified more quickly. The authors hypothesized that the negative word deficit with CFS reflects greater habituation (i.e., a cognitive aftereffect) that accrues for negative words before the observer becomes aware of the word. However, aftereffects typically occur in response to a target stimulus that follows an adapting stimulus, rather than in response to a single stimulus that is initially processed without awareness. Thus, it is not immediately obvious that the explanation provided by Prioli and Kahan is adequate. Here I report a simulation using a model that was previously applied to cognitive aftereffects, demonstrating that their account can explain this crossover interaction. These results suggest that CFS may be a useful technique for studying cognitive aftereffects without concern for conscious decision strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is believed that this attentional bias contributes to the maintenance of alcohol use. However, no research has examined the possibility that this bias of visual attention might actually impede the functioning of other modalities, such as the processing of accompanying auditory stimuli. This study aimed to determine if alcohol-related images engender greater sensory dominance than neutral images, such that processing accompanying information from another modality (audition) would be impeded. Drinkers who had an attentional bias to alcohol-related images performed a multisensory perception task that measured how alcohol-related versus neutral visual images affected their ability to detect and respond to simultaneously presented auditory signals. In accord with the hypothesis, compared with neutral images, the presentation of alcohol-related images impaired the ability to detect and respond to auditory signals. Increased dominance of the visual modality was demonstrated by more bimodal targets being misclassified as visual-only targets in the alcohol target condition compared with that of the neutral. Findings suggest that increased processing of alcohol-related stimuli may impede an individual's ability to encode and interpret information obtained from other sensory modalities. © 2015 American Psychological Association.

Such clinical observations suggest a link between VH and head rotation, but this was never tested. The purpose of this study was to simulate a VH in healthy subjects and examine its influence on the amplitude of active head rotation during 3D motion capture in upright stance. Subjects were asked to rotate their head three times from the straight ahead position and then to the right, back to straight ahead, to the left, and back to the straight ahead again. Three randomized conditions were run: Normal viewing, with a 1-diopter prism base down on the dominant eye, or the non-dominant eye. The most important finding is that the experimental VH whichever the eye with the prism induces a significant decrease in the mean angle of head rotation compared to the normal viewing condition. This decrease was significant for rotation to the left. We suggest that the prism-induced VH modifies the reference posture and thereby affects head rotation; further studies are needed to confirm this effect and to extend to other types of dynamic activities. © 2016 Matheron, Zandi, Wang and Kapoula."

The presence of neglect is related to core spatially lateralized deficits, but its severity is also modulated by several domain-general factors (such as alertness or sustained attention) and by task demands. We previously showed that a computer-based dual-task paradigm exploiting both lateralized and non-lateralized factors (i.e., attentional load/multitasking) better captures this complex scenario and exacerbates deficits for the contralesional space after right hemisphere damage. Here we asked whether multitasking would reveal contralesional spatial disorders in chronic left-hemisphere damaged (LHD) stroke patients, a population in which impaired spatial processing is thought to be uncommon. Ten consecutive LHD patients with no signs of right-sided neglect at standard neuropsychological testing performed a computerized spatial monitoring task with and without concurrent secondary tasks (i.e., multitasking). Severe contralesional (right) space unawareness emerged in most patients under attentional load in both the visual and auditory modalities. Multitasking affected the detection of contralesional stimuli both when presented concurrently with an ipsilesional one (i.e., extinction for bilateral targets) and when presented in isolation (i.e., left neglect for right-sided targets). No spatial bias emerged in a control group of healthy elderly participants, who performed at ceiling, as well as in a second control group composed of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment. We conclude that the pathological spatial asymmetry in LHD patients cannot be attributed to a global reduction of cognitive resources but it is the consequence of unilateral brain damage. Clinical and theoretical implications of the load-dependent lack of awareness for contralesional hemispace following LHD are discussed. © 2016

Applying the MCL algorithm results in a common gaze pattern showing a sort of perception tactic the drivers usually follow. The drivers repetitively move their gaze ahead soon after looking at somewhere else, independently of their years of experience. They are, however, found different in that experienced drivers can consistently follow the tactic while inexperienced drivers cannot. Time variation in the number of attentive pattern deviations demonstrates that, as well as the inexperienced drivers made higher frequency and larger fluctuations of pattern deviation, there were several particular segments in the route in which intensive pattern deviations arose in common. Inexperienced drivers would make intensive pattern deviations in such route segments that may have higher requirements of their cognitive resources. © 2016 IEEE.

Methods: Silica sol is a colorless and transparent colloidal gel of different particle sizes. The silica was added to an emulsion adhesive, thoroughly mixed, and coated evenly on polyethylene terephthalate films. Twelve filters with 12 different concentrations of silica were constructed. The density of the silica particles on the films was determined by scanning electron microscopy, and the haze values and light transmittance were measured with a goniophotometer. The reduction of the BCVA by the filters was determined in 16 healthy young women (mean age, 22.0 ± 2.3 years) by attaching the filters to spectacles. Results: Scanning electron microscopy showed a monolayer of evenly spaced silica particles. The haze values of the 12 filters were related to the concentration of silica. The total light transmittance of the 12 filters was not significantly correlated to the concentration of silica. The BCVAs measured with the 12 filters were significantly and inversely correlated with the concentration of silica for both eyes (right eye, y = 0.174x - 0.197, R2 = 0.951; left eye, y = 0.173x - 0.212, R2 = 0.983). Conclusions: These findings indicate that these diffusion filters can reduce the BCVA with no reduction of light transmittance. We conclude that they can be used to degrade the image of the dominant eye by known amounts in patients with amblyopia without affecting the overall light levels to the eye, i.e., form deprivation without light deprivation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

This study quantitatively evaluated whether gross stereopsis is degraded by a Bangerter filter. Seven healthy subjects (median age: 29 years) participated in this psychophysical study. Targets with crossed disparities of 1°, 2°, 3°, 4°, and 5° were randomly presented on a three-dimensional television display. The subjects indicated the point at which the targets popped out from the television screen (matching method). The distance from the screen to the point was defined as the degree of stereopsis. This experiment was performed with and without a 0.3 Bangerter filter. The corrected monocular visual acuities were decreased to about 20/63 by the filter in all subjects. No significant difference was observed for any of the disparities (1°-5°), between the degree of stereopsis visualized with and without filters for either the dominant or the non-dominant eye. The degree of stereopsis was not degraded by the reduced visual acuity induced by the use of 0.3 Bangerter filters. In this regard, the use of 0.3 Bangerter filters may be considered safer than occlusion eye patches for the patients with normal binocular vision. © 2016 by Okayama University Medical School.
"Nakayama R.; Motoyoshi I.; Sato T.";0.0;Motion dominance in binocular rivalry depends on extraretinal motions;2016;Journal of Vision;10.1167/16.5.2;In binocular rivalry, moving stimulus is dominant over stationary stimulus. This is called motion dominance. The motion here is usually a motion defined on the retina (retinal motion). However, motion can be defined in several different coordinates. It can be defined with respect to objects in the background (object-based motion) or to observers' head or body (spatiotopic motion), as well as to the retinal coordinate. In this study, we examined the role of motions defined by these three coordinates. A dichoptic pair of gratings was presented to create a binocular rivalry, one of which was moving and the other stationary. A fixation point and a reference background were either moving with the grating or stationary, depending on the condition. Different combinations of the three types of motions were created by having the observer track the fixation point or the background when they are moving. It was found that the retinal motion does not necessarily yield motion dominance, and that the motion dominance is determined by the combination of motions defined by different coordinate systems.

In this review, we will revisit the original conception of the four propositions and the scientific landscape in which this happened. We will also provide a brief update concerning distributions of dominance durations, another aspect of Levelt's monograph that has maintained a prominent presence in the field. In a critical evaluation of Levelt's propositions against current knowledge of binocular rivalry we will then demonstrate that the original propositions are not completely compatible with what is known today, but that they can, in a straightforward way, be modified to encapsulate the progress that has been made over the past fifty years. The resulting modified, propositions are shown to apply to a broad range of bistable perceptual phenomena, not just binocular rivalry, and they allow important inferences about the underlying neural systems. We argue that these inferences reflect canonical neural properties that play a role in visual perception in general, and we discuss ways in which future research can build on the work reviewed here to attain a better understanding of these properties. © 2015 The Authors.

Experimental results were obtained using certified hardware. Recording of the surface EMG was performed using the ""Neuro-Mvp"" multipurpose computer system. Motor tasks under the control of binocular vision in the age of 5-6 years are implemented with the key role of the dominant eye. The narrowing of the visual field by means of closing the dominant eye during performance of a single manual action reduces the bioelectric activity of muscles due to the decrease in the maximum amplitude of the EMG signal, which indicates the reduction in the rate of muscles contraction. At the binocular method of sight, EMG of all studied muscle groups is characterized by the uniform bioelectric activity. When one is holding the ""Flamingo"" pose with closed eyes, disruption of the stability of the parameters of bioelectric activity takes place, which is manifested as appearing sharp bursts of the bioelectric activity in the EMG patterns. The sight space narrowing at closing the dominant eye leads to disruption of the bioelectric stability of postural muscles of the back and thigh. The sight space narrowing at closing the subdominant eye during holding the ""Flamingo"" pose leads to disruption of the bioelectric stability of postural muscles of the thigh."

Methods: A prospective, double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted. Ten naturally emmetropic and presbyopic subjects between 42 and 58 years old with uncorrected distance visual acuity of at least 20/20 in both eyes without additional ocular pathology were eligible for inclusion. All subjects received 3% carbachol and 0.2% brimonidine in both combined and separate forms, 3% carbachol alone and 0.2% brimonidine (control) alone in their non-dominant eye in a crossover manner with one week washout between tests. The subjects’ pupil sizes and both near and distance visual acuities will be evaluated pre- and post-treatment at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h, by a masked examiner at the same room illumination. Results: Statistically significant improvement in mean near visual acuity (NVA) was achieved in all subjects who received combined 3% carbachol and 0.2% brimonidine in the same formula compared with those who received separate forms or carbachol alone or brimonidine alone (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Based on the data, the combined solution demonstrated greater efficacy than the other solutions that were tested. Improving the depth of focus by making the pupil small caused statistically significant improvement in near visual acuity, with no change in binocular distance vision.

However, outcomes vary considerably, even after accounting for comorbidity-for example, after cochlear implantation, some deaf children develop spoken language skills approaching those of their hearing peers, whereas other children fail to do so. Here, we review evidence that auditory deprivation has widespread effects on brain development, affecting the capacity to process information beyond the auditory system. After sensory loss and deafness, the brain's effective connectivity is altered within the auditory system, between sensory systems, and between the auditory system and centres serving higher order neurocognitive functions. As a result, congenital sensory loss could be thought of as a connectome disease, with interindividual variability in the brain's adaptation to sensory loss underpinning much of the observed variation in outcome of cochlear implantation. Different executive functions, sequential processing, and concept formation are at particular risk in deaf children. A battery of clinical tests can allow early identification of neurocognitive risk factors. Intervention strategies that address these impairments with a personalised approach, taking interindividual variations into account, will further improve outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The Diopsys NOVA-TR system was used to record the VEP amplitude and latency of 10 visually-normal, presbyopic, adult subjects aged 50 to 70 years (60, SEM0.17 years). First, eye dominance was assessed in two ways: a sensory-based ""sensitivity to blur task"" and a motor-based ""sighting task."" Next, while monocularly defocused, subjects binocularly viewed a black-and-white checkerboard (20-min arc size), pattern-reversal stimulus under 7 different test conditions: (1) baseline, (2) dominant (DE) eye blurred +1 diopter (D), (3) nondominant (NDE) eye blurred +1 D, (4) DE +2 D, (5) NDE +2 D, (6) DE +3 D, and (7) NDE +3 D. Results: Under nearly all conditions (22/2492%), the amplitude and latency were significantly different from baseline with any amount of defocus (P<0.05). Monocular defocus decreased, and increased, the mean binocular VEP amplitude and latency, respectively. There were no significant differences in either the binocular VEP amplitude or latency values when comparing defocused dominant vs. nondominant eyes. Conclusions: Eye dominance type (i.e., sensory or motor) and status (i.e., DE or NDE) did not provide a differential effect with respect to the VEP findings.

To assess the feasibility of macular integrity assessment (MAIA) microperimetry (MP) in children. Also to establish representative outcome measures (differential light sensitivity, fixation stability, test–retest reliability) for children without visual impairment. METHODS. Thirty-three adults and 33 children (9–12 years) were asked to perform three monocular MAIA examinations within a single session (dominant eye only). RESULTS. Children exhibited poorer test–retest reliability than adults for measures of both mean sensitivity (95% coefficient of repeatability [CoR95] ¼ 2.7 vs. 2.3 dB, P ¼ 0.036) and pointwise sensitivity (CoR95 ¼ 6.2 vs. 5.7 dB, P < 0.001). Mean sensitivity was lower in children (27.6 vs. 29.5 dB, P < 0.001), and fixation stability was poorer (95% bivariate contour ellipse area [BCEA95] ¼ 4.58 vs. 1.14, P < 0.001). Mean sensitivity was negatively correlated with fixation stability (r ¼ _0.44, P < 0.001). Both children and adults exhibited substantial practice effects, with mean sensitivity improving by 0.5 dB (adults) and 0.9 dB (children) between examinations 1 and 2 (P ≤ 0.017). There were no significant differences between examinations 2 and 3 (P ≥ 0.374). CONCLUSIONS. Microperimetry is feasible in 9- to 12-year-old children. However, systematically lower sensitivities mean that the classification boundary for “healthy” performance should be lowered in children, pending development of techniques to improve attentiveness/fixation that may reduce or remove this difference. High measurement variability suggests that the results of multiple tests should be averaged when possible. Learning effects are a potential confound, and it is recommended that the results of the first examination be discarded. © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

A contemporary non-mediational hypothesis holds that S' and D' are specific to distinct optical variables. We report two experiments with an optical tunnel, an arrangement of alternating black and white concentric rings, that allows systematic manipulation of the optic array at a point of observation while controlling a variety of size and depth cues. Participants viewed targets of different sizes at different distances monocularly, reporting S' and D' via magnitude production. In Experiment 1, the target was either placed in a continuous tunnel (extending 164 cm) or in a tunnel that truncated at the target's location. Experiment 2 included a third tunnel, one that was truncated with a flat depiction of the posterior surface structure that would have been visible in the continuous tunnel. In both experiments, S' decreased with D but D' was unaffected by S. Partial correlation analyses showed that the relationship between S' and D' was not significant when the contributions of other variables were removed. Importantly, S' and D' were affected differently by manipulations of the optical tunnel's continuity while computationally obvious visual cues were controlled. These outcomes suggest that D' is not a mediator of S'. Rather S' and D' are independently determined with correlated but different optical bases, results that support the direct model. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report the concentration of sex hormones predicts the strength and vividness of visual mental imagery. We employed an objective measure of imagery utilizing binocular rivalry and a subjective questionnaire to assess imagery. The strength and vividness of imagery was greater for females in the mid luteal phase than both females in the late follicular phase and males. Further, imagery strength and vividness were significantly correlated with salivary progesterone concentration. For the same participants, performance on visual and verbal working memory tasks was not predicted by progesterone concentration. These results suggest sex hormones might influence visual imagery, but not general working memory. As hormone concentration changes over time, this implies a partial dynamic basis for individual differences in visual mental imagery, any dependent cognition and mental disorders. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

"Lunghi C.; Morrone M.C.; Secci J.; Caputo R.";0.0;Binocular rivalry measured 2 hours after occlusion therapy predicts the recovery rate of the amblyopic eye in anisometropic children;2016;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;10.1167/iovs.15-18419;PURPOSE. Recent studies on adults have shown that short-term monocular deprivation boosts the deprived eye signal in binocular rivalry, reflecting homeostatic plasticity. Here we investigate whether homeostatic plasticity is present also during occlusion therapy for moderate amblyopia. METHODS. Binocular rivalry and visual acuity (using Snellen charts for children) were measured in 10 children (mean age 6.2±6 1 years) with moderate anisometropic amblyopia before the beginning of treatment and at four intervals during occlusion therapy (2 hours, 1, 2, and 5 months). Visual stimuli were orthogonal gratings presented dichoptically through ferromagnetic goggles and children reported verbally visual rivalrous perception. Bangerter filters were applied on the spectacle lens over the best eye for occlusion therapy. RESULTS. Two hours of occlusion therapy increased the nonamblyopic eye predominance over the amblyopic eye compared with pretreatment measurements, consistent with the results in adults. The boost of the nonamblyopic eye was still present after 1 month of treatment, steadily decreasing afterward to reach pretreatment levels after 2 months of continuous occlusion. Across subjects, the increase in nonamblyopic eye predominance observed after 2 hours of occlusion correlated (rho =-0.65, P =0.04) with the visual acuity improvement of the amblyopic eye measured after 2 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Homeostatic plasticity operates during occlusion therapy for moderate amblyopia and the increase in nonamblyopic eye dominance observed at the beginning of treatment correlates with the amblyopic eye recovery rate. These results suggest that binocular rivalry might be used to monitor visual cortical plasticity during occlusion therapy, although further investigations on larger clinical populations are needed to validate the predictive power of the technique. © 2016 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

We aim to investigate the potential cause of this finding by varying the amount of stereopsis available to the subject, and assessing their perception of depth viewing 3-D video clips and a Nintendo 3DS.Methods: Monocular blur was used to vary interocular VA difference, consequently creating 4 levels of measurable binocular deficit from normal stereoacuity to suppression. Stereoacuity was assessed at each level using the TNO, Preschool Randot®, Frisby, the FD2, and Distance Randot®. Subjects also completed an object depth identification task using the Nintendo 3DS, a static 3DTV stereoacuity test, and a 3-D perception rating task of 6 video clips.Results: As intraocular VA differences increased, stereoacuity of the 57 subjects (aged 16-62 years) decreased (eg, 110"", 280"", 340"", and suppression). The ability to correctly identify depth on the Nintendo 3DS remained at 100% until suppression of one eye occurred. The perception of a compelling 3-D effect when viewing the video clips was rated high until suppression of one eye occurred, where the 3-D effect was still reported as fairly evident.Conclusion: If an individual has any level of measurable stereoacuity, the perception of 3-D when viewing stereoscopic entertainment is present. The presence of motion in stereoscopic video appears to provide cues to depth, where static cues are not sufficient. This suggests there is a need for a dynamic test of stereoacuity to be developed, to allow fully informed patient management decisions to be made. © 2015 Laurence P. Tidbury, Robert H.

Design Three-treatment randomized clinical trial of presbyopia-correcting IOLs with comparison to results from a previous nonrandomized multicenter clinical trial on the KAMRA corneal inlay. Methods Study population of 507 subjects with KAMRA inlays; predetermined subgroups included 327 subjects that underwent contrast sensitivity testing and another 114 subjects for defocus curve testing, along with 78 subjects randomized between bilateral Crystalens Advanced Optics (AO) (Bausch + Lomb Surgical, Aliso Viejo, California, USA), AcrySof IQ ReSTOR +3.0 D (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, Texas, USA), or Tecnis +4D Multifocal (MF) (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, California, USA) IOL. Results KAMRA inlay subjects demonstrated improved intermediate and near vision with minimal to no change to distance vision, better contrast sensitivity in the inlay eye when compared to the multifocals, and better binocular contrast sensitivity when compared to all 3 intraocular lenses. Crystalens AO was superior in uncorrected intermediate vision compared to the KAMRA inlay, but not in distance-corrected intermediate, and was worse in near vision. The multifocals were superior in near vision at their respective optimum near focus points, but worse in intermediate vision compared to both KAMRA inlay and Crystalens AO. Conclusions The demonstrated performance of these devices should be considered, along with subjects' visual demands and expectations, degree of crystalline lens dysfunction, and other ocular characteristics, in guiding the selection of small-aperture corneal inlay or specific intraocular lens in the correction of presbyopia. © 2015 BY ELSEVIER INC.

In this study, we therefore aimed to examine the capacity of the visual system to aniso-accommodate by objectively measuring the interocular difference in the accommodation response between fellow dominant and non-dominant eyes under controlled monocular and binocular viewing conditions during short-term exposure to aniso-accommodative stimuli. Methods: The accommodative response of each eye of 16 young isometropic adults (mean age 22 ± 2 years) with normal binocular vision was measured using an open-field autorefractor during a range of testing conditions; monocularly (accommodative demands ranging from 1.32 to 4.55 D) and binocularly while altering the accommodation demand for each eye (aniso-accommodative stimuli ranging from 0.24 to 2.05 D). Results: Under monocular viewing conditions, the dominant and non-dominant eyes displayed a highly symmetric accommodative response; mean interocular difference in spherical equivalent 0.01 ± 0.06 D (relative) and 0.22 ± 0.06 D (absolute) (p > 0.05). During binocular viewing, the dominant eye displayed a greater accommodative response (0.11 ± 0.34 D relative and 0.24 ± 0.26 D absolute) irrespective of whether the demand of the dominant or non-dominant eye was altered (p = 0.01). Astigmatic power vectors J0 and J45 did not vary between eyes or with increasing accommodation demands under monocular or binocular viewing conditions (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The dominant and non-dominant eyes of young isometropic individuals display a similar consensual lag of accommodation under both monocular and binocular viewing conditions, with the dominant eye showing a small but significantly greater (by 0.12-0.25 D) accommodative response. Evidence of short-term aniso-accommodation in response to asymmetric accommodation demands was not observed. The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2015."
"Kitayama S.; Fujikake H.; Kokubu M.; Higuchi T.";0.0;The relationship between spatial cognition and walking trajectory for passing through a doorway: Evident in individuals with dominant right eye?;2015;Experimental Brain Research;10.1007/s00221-014-4155-y;When individuals attempt to walk through the center of a doorway (i.e., spatial bisection), the body’s midpoint at crossing can deviate from its true center. Such deviation could result from asymmetry in spatial cognition. However, previous studies failed to find a significant correlation between bisection performance during walking and that during line/spatial bisection. We investigated whether such failure would result from different effectors being used for bisection (i.e., body midpoint or finger/laser pointer). We also investigated whether the difference in an individual’s eye dominance would affect the relationship. Thirty-two young adults (16 of them with right-eye dominance) participated. For a walking task, participants walked through the perceived center of a wide doorway. For a spatial bisection task, they observed the same doorway under two distance conditions (about 0.5 and 2 m) and aligned their body midpoint with the perceived center in the sagittal dimension. Both tasks were performed under three visual occlusion conditions (dominant eye, non-dominant eye, and no occlusion). The results showed that, for the spatial bisection task, occluding the dominant eye caused deviation of the bisected point to the contralateral side. However, for the walking task, such an effect was observed only in participants with a dominant right eye. Consequently, directional biases in both tasks were significantly correlated only for right-eye-dominant participants. These results suggest that, for right-eye-dominant individuals only, use of the same effector for both tasks showed a clear relationship between the two tasks. Possible explanations for these findings were discussed. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

We have defined the lateral preference in 69 individuals (40 males and 29 females, age range 5–47 years) with WBS confirmed by molecular testing, and explored its correlation with cognition, behavior problems, the main aspects of the behavioral phenotype, and specific molecular variants (parental origin and size of the 7q11.23 deletion). Lateral preference (hand, foot, eye and ear) and neurobehavioral features [intelligence quotient (IQ), sociability, visuospatial construction, narrative skills and behavior] were assessed by a battery of tests and parental interviews. A large proportion of WBS individuals showed either left or mixed handedness (26 and 19 %, respectively). Hand, foot and ear lateral preference showed significant association with IQ, with individuals with mixed lateral preference presenting lower general IQ, especially verbal IQ, with respect to subjects with well-defined laterality. Approachability, visuospatial ability, behavior problems or molecular variants were not associated with lateral preference. Our results indicate that, as in other neurodevelopmental disorders, laterality is poorly defined in a significant proportion of WBS individuals, and reinforces the idea that a correct definition of lateral preference is important for cognition and language. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
"Vergeer M.; Moors P.; Wagemans J.; van Ee R.";0.0;Visible and invisible stimulus parts integrate into global object representations as revealed by combining monocular and binocular rivalry;2016;Journal of Vision;10.1167/16.11.14;Our visual system faces the challenging task to construct integrated visual representations from the visual input projected on our retinae. Previous research has provided mixed evidence as to whether visual awareness of the stimulus parts is required for such integration to occur. Here, we address this issue by taking a novel approach in which we combine a monocular rivalry stimulus (i.e., a bistable rotating cylinder) with binocular rivalry. The results of Experiment 1 show that in a rivalry condition, where one half of the cylinder is perceptually suppressed, significantly more perceptual switches occur that are consistent with visual integration of the whole cylinder than occur in a control condition, where only half of the cylinder is presented at a time and the presentation of the two images is physically alternated. In Experiment 2, stimulation in the observer's dominant eye was kept dominant by presenting the half cylinder in this eye at higher contrast and by surrounding it with a flickering context. Results show that the strong convexity bias that was found in a control condition, where no stimulus was presented in the suppressed eye, almost completely disappears when the unseen half is presented in the suppressed eye, indicating that both halves visually integrate and, subsequently, compete for convexity. These findings provide evidence that unseen visual information is biased towards a representation that is congruent with the current visible representation and, hence, that principles of perceptual organization also apply to parts of the visual input that remain unseen by the observer.
"Dieter K.C.; Melnick M.D.; Tadin D.";0.0;Perceptual training profoundly alters binocular rivalry through both sensory and attentional enhancements;2016;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America;10.1073/pnas.1602722113;The effects of attention, as well as its functional utility, are particularly prominent when selecting among multiple stimuli that compete for processing resources. However, existing studies have found that binocular rivalry-a phenomenon characterized by perceptual competition between incompatible stimuli presented to the two eyes-is only modestly influenced by selective attention. Here, we demonstrate that the relative resistance of binocular rivalry to selective modulations gradually erodes over the course of extended perceptual training that uses a demanding, featurebased attentional task. The final result was a dramatic alteration in binocular rivalry dynamics, leading to profound predominance of the trained stimulus. In some cases, trained observers saw the trained rival image nearly exclusively throughout 4-min viewing periods. This large change in binocular rivalry predominance was driven by two factors: task-independent, eye-specific changes in visual processing, as well as an enhanced ability of attention to promote predominance of the task-relevant stimulus. Notably, this strengthening of task-driven attention also exhibited eye specificity above and beyond that from observed sensory processing changes. These empirical results, along with simulations from a recently developed model of interocular suppression, reveal that stimulus predominance during binocular rivalry can be realized both through an eye-specific boost in processing of sensory information and through facilitated deployment of attention to taskrelevant features in the trained eye. Our findings highlight the interplay of attention and binocular rivalry at multiple visual processing stages and reveal that sustained training can substantially alter early visual mechanisms.
"Gautier J.; Bedell H.E.; Siderov J.; Waugh S.J.";0.0;Monocular microsaccades are visual-task related;2016;Journal of Vision;10.1167/16.3.37;During visual fixation, we constantly move our eyes. These microscopic eye movements are composed of tremor, drift, and microsaccades. Early studies concluded that microsaccades, like larger saccades, are binocular and conjugate, as expected from Hering's law of equal innervation. Here, we document the existence of monocular microsaccades during both fixation and a discrimination task, reporting the location of the gap in a foveal, low-contrast letter C. Monocular microsaccades differ in frequency, amplitude, and peak velocity from binocular microsaccades. Our analyses show that these differences are robust to different velocity and duration criteria that have been used previously to identify microsaccades. Also, the frequency of monocular microsaccades differs systematically according to the task: monocular microsaccades occur more frequently during fixation than discrimination, the opposite of their binocular equivalents. However, during discrimination, monocular microsaccades occur more often around the discrimination threshold, particularly for each subject's dominant eye and in case of successful discrimination. We suggest that monocular microsaccades play a functional role in the production of fine corrections of eye position and vergence during demanding visual tasks.

These variations reflect functional specialisation of the cerebral hemispheres as well as the ventral/dorsal visual streams for processing stimuli located in near and far space. Prior research has demonstrated visual field superiorities for processing near space in the lower and right hemispaces and for far space in the upper and left hemispaces. No research, however, has directly tested whether the functional specialisation of the visual fields actually makes objects look closer when presented in the lower or right visual fields. To measure biases in the perception of depth, we employed anaglyph stimuli where participants made closer/further judgments about the relative location of two spheres in a three-dimensional virtual space. We observed clear processing differences in this task where participants perceived the right and lower spheres to be closer and the left and upper spheres to be further away. Furthermore, no relationship between the horizontal and vertical dimensions was observed suggesting separate cognitive/neural mechanisms. Not only does this methodology clearly demonstrate differences in perceived depth across the visual field, it also opens up many possibilities for studying functional asymmetries in three-dimensional space. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Conventional therapy for amblyopia which focuses on monocular training can improve visual acuity. However, how to improve the binocular function, especially stereopsis is rarely studied. Objective: This study was to evaluate the outcome of perceptual learning based on cloud services of improving stereopsis and visual acuity for amblyopia. Methods: A randomized-controlled clinical study was performed. One hundred and seven amblyopic patients (178 eyes) with the age of 5-18 years old were recruited in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from July 2013 to March 2014. The patients were randomized into the perceptual learning group and the conventional therapy group. A perceptual learning based on cloud services with computer under the best corrected visual acuity was carried out in the perceptual learning group with 30-day duration as a course for 5-6 cycles, and training feedback data was obtained after each cycle for the regulation of following treatment. The dominant eye was covered during the training process. In the conventional therapy group, a training regimen of health eye covering that combined with eyesight training of amblyopic eye was performed. The stereopsis and visual acuity of the patients were estimated after training. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or custodians of the children before entering the cohort. Results: The total effective rate of visual acuity improvement is significantly higher in the perceptual learning group than that in the conventional therapy group after training (Z=6.368, P=0.012). The mean stereopsis value of the amblyopic eyes in the perceptual learning group and the conventional therapy group was (127±53)″ and (174±67)″ after training, which was significantly higher than (273±95)″ and (311±103)″ before training, respectively, and the increasing range of the mean stereopsis was considerably larger in the perceptual learning group than that in the conventional therapy group (t=12.329, 9.557, 15.649; all at P<0.05). In the perceptual learning group, the improving range of mean stereopsis was larger in the severe or moderate amblyopic eyes than that in the mild amblyopic eyes, and the improving range of mean stereopsis in ametropic amblyopia was larger than that in anisometropic amblyopia (all at P<0.05). Conclusions: Both perceptual learning based on cloud services and conventional therapy can improve stereopsis and visual acuity in amblyopic eyes. However, perceptual learning based on cloud services can improve the treating compliance of children. Copyright © 2016 by the Chinese Medical Association."

Evidence is presented indicating that these disorders might be prevented by delaying the introduction of letter writing until the age of 8 years. Early childhood speech categorization in children genetically at-risk of developing dyslexia is also considered from this perspective. Convergent support for this premature writing hypothesis is provided by a comparison with the development of the left-hand inverted writing posture. © Perceptual & Motor Skills 2015.

We investigated whether real-time neurofeedback training of the alpha lateralization enhances participants' ability to modulate posterior alpha lateralization and causes subsequent short-term changes in visual detection performance. The experiment consisted of three phases: (i) pre-training assessment, (ii) neurofeedback phase and (iii) post-training assessment. In the pre- and post-training phases we measured the threshold to covertly detect a cued faint Gabor stimulus presented in the left or right hemifield. During magnetoencephalography (MEG) neurofeedback, two face stimuli superimposed with noise were presented bilaterally. Participants were cued to attend to one of the hemifields. The transparency of the superimposed noise and thus the visibility of the stimuli were varied according to the momentary degree of hemispheric alpha lateralization. In a double-blind procedure half of the participants were provided with sham feedback. We found that hemispheric alpha lateralization increased with the neurofeedback training; this was mainly driven by an ipsilateral alpha increase. Surprisingly, comparing pre- to post-training, detection performance decreased for a Gabor stimulus presented in the hemifield that was un-attended during neurofeedback. This effect was not observed in the sham group. Thus, neurofeedback training alters alpha lateralization, which in turn decreases performances in the untrained hemifield. Our findings suggest that alpha oscillations play a causal role for the allocation of attention. Furthermore, our neurofeedback protocol serves to reduce the detection of unattended visual information and could therefore be of potential use for training to reduce distractibility in attention deficit patients, but also highlights that neurofeedback paradigms can have negative impact on behavioral performance and should be applied with caution. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Until now less interest has been given to connections between dental occlusion and ophthalmology, even if they are important and involving. Clinical experience in dental practice claims that mandibular latero-deviation is connected both to eye dominance and to defects of ocular convergence. The trigeminal nerve is the largest and most complex of the twelve cranial nerves. The trigeminal system represents the connection between somitic structures and those derived from the branchial arches, collecting the proprioception from both somitic structures and oculomotor muscles. The intermedius nucleus of the medulla is a small perihypoglossal brainstem nucleus, which acts to integrate information from the head and neck and relays it on to the nucleus of the solitary tract where autonomic responses are generated. This intriguing neurophysiological web led our research group to investigate anatomical and functional associations between dental occlusion and vision. In conclusion, nervous system and functional pathways strictly connect vision and dental occlusion, and in the future both dentists and oculists should be more and more aware of this correlation for a better diagnosis and therapy. © 2016 Bentham Open."

The goal of the present study was to disentangle motor and perceptual components of egocentric midline manipulations and to investigate the contribution of individual hand preference. Two versions of visual temporal order judgment (TOJ) tasks were tested in healthy right- and left-handed subjects while trunk rotation was varied. In the congruent version, subjects were required to execute a saccade to the first of two horizontal stimuli presented with different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA). In the incongruent version, subjects were required to perform a vertical saccade to a pre-learned color target, thereby dissociating motor response from the perceptual stimulus location. The main findings of this study are a trunk rotation and response direction specific impact on temporal judgments in form of a prior entry bias for right hemifield stimuli during rightward trunk rotation, but only in the congruent task. This trunk rotation-induced spatial bias was most pronounced in left-handed participants but had the same sign in the right-handed group. Results suggest that egocentric midline shifts in healthy subjects induce a spatially-specific motor, but not a perceptual, bias and underline the importance of taking individual differences in functional laterality such as handedness and mode of perceptual report into account when evaluating effects of trunk rotation in either healthy subjects or neurological patients. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This ability declines with age due to largely unknown reasons, and it also is altered following stroke. Brain aging is associated with a progressive increase of the levels of inflammatory cytokine in the brain. Likewise, stroke causes pronounced increases of inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Following stroke, plasticity of the cortical representation following sensory deprivation and visualized with [14C]-2-deoxyglucose autoradiography is impaired for several weeks. Likewise, plasticity of visual acuity induced by occlusion of the ipsilateral eye is impaired. Both forms of plasticity may be rescued by treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast to this, ocular dominance plasticity which is also induced by visual occlusion is not rescued by this intervention, neither following stroke nor in aged brains. Antiinflammatory interventions may therefore be a useful tool to enhance brain plasticity following stroke, but need to be supplemented by additional strategies to enhance brain plasticity. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.

In this work, we have studied binocular visual performance of 12 subjects after inducing different degrees of anisocoria combined with two different add powers in the non-dominant eye. We have analysed visual performance in terms of the visual-discrimination capacity (a function to evaluate the strength of bothersome halos) and the contrast-sensitivity. The results show a deterioration of the binocular vision when inducing anisocoria and with any add power, with a higher perception of halos, a lower contrast sensitivity and poorer binocular summation of these visual functions on increasing anisocoria. This deterioration is clinically acceptable in the case of low add power, since positive binocular summation is maintained in contrast sensitivity, and visual discrimination is not altered. © 2016 Optical Society of America.

When one increases the brightness of dominant eye's view while decreasing the other, the crosstalk effectively decreases for the dominant eye but increases for the other.

"Holten V.; Stuit S.M.; Verstraten F.A.J.; van der Smagt M.J.";0.0;Grouping of optic flow stimuli during binocular rivalry is driven by monocular information;2016;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2016.08.002;During binocular rivalry, perception alternates between two dissimilar images, presented dichoptically. Although binocular rivalry is thought to result from competition at a local level, neighboring image parts with similar features tend to be perceived together for longer durations than image parts with dissimilar features. This simultaneous dominance of two image parts is called grouping during rivalry. Previous studies have shown that this grouping depends on a shared eye-of-origin to a much larger extent than on image content, irrespective of the complexity of a static image. In the current study, we examine whether grouping of dynamic optic flow patterns is also primarily driven by monocular (eye-of-origin) information. In addition, we examine whether image parameters, such as optic flow direction, and partial versus full visibility of the optic flow pattern, affect grouping durations during rivalry. The results show that grouping of optic flow is, as is known for static images, primarily affected by its eye-of-origin. Furthermore, global motion can affect grouping durations, but only under specific conditions. Namely, only when the two full optic flow patterns were presented locally. These results suggest that grouping during rivalry is primarily driven by monocular information even for motion stimuli thought to rely on higher-level motion areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd
"Mann D.L.; Runswick O.R.; Allen P.M.";0.0;Hand and Eye Dominance in Sport: Are Cricket Batters Taught to Bat Back-to-Front?;2016;Sports Medicine;10.1007/s40279-016-0516-y;Background: When first learning to bimanually use a tool to hit a target (e.g., when chopping wood or hitting a golf ball), most people assume a stance that is dictated by their dominant hand. By convention, this means that a ‘right-handed’ or ‘left-handed’ stance that places the dominant hand closer to the striking end of the tool is adopted in many sports. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the conventional stance used for bimanual hitting provides the best chance of developing expertise in that task. Methods: Our study included 43 professional (international/first-class) and 93 inexperienced (<5 years’ experience) cricket batsmen. We determined their batting stance (plus hand and eye dominance) to compare the proportion of batters who adopted a reversed stance when batting (that is, the opposite stance to that expected based on their handedness). Results: We found that cricket batsmen who adopted a reversed stance had a stunning advantage, with professional batsmen 7.1 times more likely to adopt a reversed stance than inexperienced batsmen, independent of whether they batted right or left handed or the position of their dominant eye. Conclusion: Findings imply that batsmen who adopt a conventional stance may inadvertently be batting ‘back-to-front’ and have a significant disadvantage in the game. Moreover, the results may generalize more widely, bringing into question the way in which other bimanual sporting actions are taught and performed. © 2016, The Author(s).

Methods: A prospective study of 32 healthy female subjects was conducted. Each subject underwent 1) a questionnaire on daily schedule, 2) the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), and 3) ocular examinations including an eye dominance test, fundus photography, and sequential optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, on two separate days at five fixed 3h time intervals. Choroidal thickness was measured by two masked graders. Results: A significant diurnal variation of choriodal thickness at fovea (P<0.001), at 500 μm nasal (P<0.001), temporal to fovea (P=0.01) or 1500 μm nasal to fovea (P=0.001) was observed. The median choroidal thickness peaked at 11:00 at fovea (P=0.01), at 500 μm nasal (P=0.009) and temporal (P=0.03) to fovea. The median amplitude of foveal choroidal thickness was 20.5 μm (13, 31) and 20.0 μm (12.5, 28.2) for the first and second series of measurements, respectively. The greater amplitude of foveal choroidal thickness was associated with thickner initial foveal choroidal thickness [0.05 (0.03, 0.08), P=0.01], dominant eye [10.51 (4.02, 14.60), P=0.04] in the multivariate linear regression. Conclusion: Our data show a significant diurnal variation of the choroidal thickness at fovea, at 500 μm nasal and temporal to fovea and 1500 μm nasal to fovea. Thicker initial foveal choroidal thickness and being dominant eye may influence the amplitude of foveal choroidal thickness. © 2016, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office), All rights reserved.

Either emotionally colored words or “pseudowords” were presented as stimuli; among 60 examined subjects, there were 30 sinistrals with dominant left eye and 30 dextrals with dominant right eye. In right-handed subjects, the coherence of theta oscillations in central and parietal pairs of the leads increased during binocular perception of verbal emotionally colored information, while a rise in the level of coherence of high-frequency beta oscillations in intrahemispheric lead pairs was observed in left-handers under the same conditions. In the course of binocular performance of both types of tests, interhemispheric coherence was altered, while changes of coherence were found only within one hemisphere during monocular perception. In dextrals, the level of synchronization of the activity in local networks demonstrated a significantly higher rise in the left hemisphere in the case where pseudoword signals were used. In sinistrals, such an increase was observed in both hemispheres together with a decrease in the interhemispheric interaction. In tests of both types during monocular perception of both emotionally colored words and pseudowords via a dominant eye, EEG activity was rather similar in both dextrals and sinistrals. This fact may indicate that nonrelevant semantic context of the stimuli during processing of information incoming via the dominant visual canal is mostly ignored. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Although the Colavita effect remains robust irrespective of many factors, little is known concerning how the visual dominance varies as a function of the depth of sensory inputs. In the present study, visual and auditory stimuli were presented either in the same (in Experiment 1) or in the different spatial distances (in Experiment 2). Participants were asked to make speeded responses to unimodal auditory, unimodal visual, or bimodal audiovisual stimuli. In the incorrectly responded bimodal trials, the error trials in which responses were made only to the visual component were compared with the trials in which responses were made only to the auditory component. In the correctly responded bimodal trials, the trials in which participants responded first to the visual component were compared with the trials in which participants responded first to the auditory component. Analysis on the incorrect and correct bimodal trials both indicated significant visual dominance effects. More importantly, the size of the visual dominance effect was significantly enhanced as long as the visual stimuli were presented in far space irrespective of whether the auditory stimuli were presented in near or far space. Our results thus, for the first time, revealed that the visual dominance effect changed along the depth dimension of space. Taken together, the present results shed lights on how the allocation of attentional resources along the depth dimension of space biases the process of multisensory competition. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Methods: Longitudinal, comparative case series of hyperopic presbyopes who underwent presbyLASIK, in a private clinical setting. Monovision symmetrical (plano target both eyes) versus asymmetrical [dominant eye (DE) plano target; nondominant eye (NDE)-0.50 diopter (D) target]. Pre-and postoperative variables included monocular and binocular, distance and near, uncorrected visual acuity (VA), best corrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent, addition (Add), topography SimK (Km), and topographic astigmatism.

In the field of clinical neuro-ophthalmology, it is well-established that ocular dominance plays a key role in several eye diseases. Furthermore, the accurate quantification of ocular dominance is crucial with regard to certain surgical techniques. However, classical preoperative tests cannot determine the amount of ocular dominance. Materials and methods. - In order to obtain further insight into the phenomenon of ocular dominance, we study its influence at behavioral and neurophysiological levels (experiments 1 and 2).Based on these new data, we suggest a method to improve quantification of ocular dominance(experiment 3). Results. - We demonstrate that ocular dominance has an influence on hand movements and oninterhemispheric transfer time. Moreover, we show that an analysis of the dynamics of saccades allows us to sort out participants with strong or weak ocular dominance. Conclusion. - In conclusion, this better understanding of the phenomenon of ocular dominance,coupled with the analysis of saccadic dynamics, might, in the short or medium term, lead to the establishment of a quick and straightforward battery of tests allowing determination of the amount of ocular dominance for each patient. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS: A Raindrop Near Vision Inlay (ReVision Optics, Lake Forest, CA) was implanted monocularly on the stromal bed of a femtosecond laser-assisted generated corneal flap of non-dominant eyes of 22 patients with emmetropic presbyopia (preoperative spherical equivalent range: -0.50 to 1.00 diopters). Efficacy was determined by measuring near and distance visual acuities and ocular aberrations, and satisfaction was assessed by a patient questionnaire. RESULTS: The preoperative monocular uncorrected near visual acuity of the inlay inserted eye was 20/129 ± 1 Snellen (range: 20/135 to 20/61 Snellen) and improved to 20/35 ± 2 Snellen (range: 20/61 to 20/20 Snellen) (P < .01) at 6 months postoperatively. The monocular uncorrected distance visual acuity of the eye receiving the inlay was 20/25 ± 2 Snellen (range: 20/50 to 20/20 Snellen) preoperatively and 20/25 ± 1 Snellen (range: 20/50 to 20/20 Snellen) at 6 months postoperatively (P =.257). According to the questionnaire responses, 82% of patients were satisfied. This was despite near glasses needs remaining in 13.6% of the cohort and the presence of glare and a decrease in night vision in approximately 40% of patients. The primary spherical aberration coefficient Z40 changed from positive to negative values in all patients (P < .01). However, the point spread function showed no significant change. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogel corneal inlays improve uncorrected near visual acuity in patients with presbyopia with only moderate effect on visual quality. However, the satisfaction with this therapy was relatively lower in these Korean patients than that reported previously in Western patients. © SLACK Incorporated.

To explore sleep position in asymmetric primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) with a focus on low pressure glaucoma (LPG). Methods. Sleep laboratory videos of 54 POAG patients were examined for lateral sleep. Then, 29 LPG patients (intraocular pressure [IOP] < 22 mm Hg) with an intereye visual field index (VFI) asymmetry of more than 5% continuously recorded their sleep position at home for 2 nights by using a portable device. Correlations were sought between sleep position, visual field (VF), and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) symmetry as well as ocular biometric data and positional IOP changes. Finally, an expanded data set of 178 POAG patients (63 LPG and 115 high pressure glaucoma [HPG; IOP ≥ 22 mm Hg]) was used to correlate VF and the RNFL symmetry to the self-assessed sleep position collected in a survey. Results. In the video analysis, patients spent 19% ± 2% (mean ± SEM) more time sleeping on one side than on the other. Right-sided sleep was preferred. Right-sided sleep was 1.6 times more common in continuously recorded home data and correlated to an asymmetric VF that was worse in the left eye (b = −0.422, P = 0.002). Pulse amplitude of left eyes was lower in the right decubitus position (P = 0.02). In the expanded survey, 73% of LPG and 58% of HPG patients slept asymmetrically. Right-sided sleepers had a worse RNFL symmetry score. Conclusions. Asymmetric sleep behavior is common. Right-sided sleep was preferred and correlated with a lower VFI on the left. © 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."

Eye dominance was determined by modified Miles technique following a complete eye examination. Handedness was assessed with the Edinburgh handedness inventory. Interpupillary distance was measured with millimetric ruler. Stereoacuity was measured in both contour (Titmus test) and random dot (TNO test) stereograms. The stereopsis scores were evaluated in terms of hand or eye dominance. The correlation between stereopsis score and interpupillary distance was assessed. Main outcome measures were stereopsis scores according to hand and eye dominance. As a result, right- and left-handed individuals showed no differences in terms of stereopsis. No differences were found in stereopsis scores between right- and left-eye dominant people. There was a correlation between interpupillary distance and the depth of stereopsis (r = - 0.248, P < 0.05). Contrary to the expectation, the left and right dominant individuals did not differ in levels of stereopsis. Interpupillary distance has a positive effect on stereopsis. © 2013 Murat Aslankurt et al.

Twenty participants were individually shown an 80-min clip of the motion picture Avatar on a 2D and a 3D television. Before and after each viewing, the participants completed a questionnaire assessing visual fatigue and discomfort. The visual acuity, accommodation speed and heterophoria of each participant were measured on another day. The results show that the 3D television caused greater visual fatigue than when the 2D television was viewed. Substantial individual differences in visual fatigue were found between participants in the 3D case and these differences varied with the accommodation speed for the non-dominant eye, the difference in visual acuity between eyes and the amount of horizontal heterophoria. Relationships between visual functions and visual fatigue during movie viewing on 3D televisions are discussed.

The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic accuracy and relationship of retinal morphologic and functional changes with motor and non-motor symptoms disturbances in Parkinson's disease. Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease, with a median Hoehn-Yahr stage of 2 (1-4), were compared to 30 age- and gender-matched controls. Retinal thinning and function were measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and pattern electroretinography. Motor impairment and motor laterality were measured using the Short Parkinson's Evaluation Scale/Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease, and non-motor symptoms severity using the non-motor symptoms questionnaire. Only pattern electroretinography, P50 and N95 amplitudes, were lower in patients with Parkinson's disease, compared to controls (p = 0.01, respectively). Age, disease duration, levodopa dose, motor, and non-motor impairment were not significantly associated with retinal thinning and functional changes. The patients vs. controls area under the curve of OCT, VEP, and pattern electroretinography receiver-operating-characteristic curves were <0.50. In conclusion, morphologic and functional retina changes are not significantly correlated with motor and non-motor symptoms impairment severity, and do not discriminate between Parkinson's disease and controls. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

The present study aimed to examine the integration mechanisms for the motor (Exp. 1) and visual modality (Exp. 2). According to theories of common coding, we assumed that visual as well as proprioceptive information is represented within the same cognitive domain and is therefore likely to affect each other (multisensory cross talk). Thus, apart from the often-confirmed visual dominance in multisensory integration, we asked about intra- and intermodal recall of either proprioceptive or visual information and whether there were any differences between the motor and visual modality. In a replication paradigm, we perturbed the relation between hand movements and cursor movements. The task required the (intra- vs. intermodal) replication of an initially performed (seen) hand (cursor) movement in a subsequent motor (visual) replication phase. First, mechanisms of integration were found to be dependent on the output modality. Visual action effects interfered the motor modality, but proprioceptive action effects did not have any effects on the visual modality. Second, however, intermodal integration was more susceptible to interference, and this was found to be independent from the output modality. Third, for the motor modality, the locus of perturbation (perturbation of cursor amplitude or perturbation of hand amplitude) was irrelevant, but for the visual modality, perturbation of hand amplitudes reduced the cross talk. Tool use is one field of application of these kinds of results, since the optimized integration of conflicting action effects is a precondition for using tools successfully. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Previous studies showed that self-reported preferences are also concordantly interrelated, suggesting a common genetic or biological origin, sidedness. However, with regard to the assessment and classification of lateral preferences, there is a dearth of psychometric studies, but a need for psychometrically validated instruments that can be reliably used in applied research. Based on three independent large samples (total N>15,100), this study investigated the psychometric properties of widely-used lateral preference scales of handedness, footedness, eyedness, and earedness. Preferences were consistently and replicably categorical, consisting of right, mixed, and left preferences each, underlining that primarily qualitative, rather than quantitative, differences differentiate lateral preferences. Right-, mixed-, and left-sidedness underlay the individual preferences, but sidedness alone could not fully explain the observed inter-relations. Footedness was the single most important indicator of sidedness. Our data were further consistent with predictions of right shift theory and corroborated a 'pull-to-concordance' in hand-foot preferences. We recommend the use of psychometrically validated scales and of a trichotomous classification of lateral preferences in future research, but conclude that handedness may be a biased indicator of underlying sidedness. Footedness needs to be examined more closely with regard to cerebral lateralization, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neurodevelopmental instability. © 2014.

One of the brain structures implicated in the social abnormalities seen in ASD is the amygdala. To further characterize the impairment of people with ASD in social attention, and to explore the possible role of the amygdala, we employed a series of visual search tasks with both social (faces and people with different postures, emotions, ages, and genders) and non-social stimuli (e.g., electronics, food, and utensils). We first conducted trial-wise analyses of fixation properties and elucidated visual search mechanisms. We found that an attentional mechanism of initial orientation could explain the detection advantage of non-social targets. We then zoomed into fixation-wise analyses. We defined target-relevant effects as the difference in the percentage of fixations that fell on target-congruent vs. target-incongruent items in the array. In Experiment 1, we tested 8 high-functioning adults with ASD, 3 adults with focal bilateral amygdala lesions, and 19 controls. Controls rapidly oriented to target-congruent items and showed a strong and sustained preference for fixating them. Strikingly, people with ASD oriented significantly less and more slowly to target-congruent items, an attentional deficit especially with social targets. By contrast, patients with amygdala lesions performed indistinguishably from controls. In Experiment 2, we recruited a different sample of 13 people with ASD and 8 healthy controls, and tested them on the same search arrays but with all array items equalized for low-level saliency. The results replicated those of Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, we recruited 13 people with ASD, 8 healthy controls, 3 amygdala lesion patients and another group of 11 controls and tested them on a simpler array. Here our group effect for ASD strongly diminished and all four subject groups showed similar target-relevant effects. These findings argue for an attentional deficit in ASD that is disproportionate for social stimuli, cannot be explained by low-level visual properties of the stimuli, and is more severe with high-load top-down task demands. Furthermore, this deficit appears to be independent of the amygdala, and not evident from general social bias independent of the target-directed search. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to explore the role of binocularity by directly comparing monocular and binocular reading in subjects with typical reading skills and normal binocular vision. A secondary purpose was to assess any asymmetry in monocular performance and its association with the sighting dominant eye. Methods: In a balanced repeated measures experiment, 18 subjects read paragraphs of text under monocular and binocular conditions. All subjects went through an optometric examination before inclusion. Reading speed and eye movements were recorded with an eye tracker. Results: The mean difference in reading speed (2.1 per cent) between monocular (dominant and non-dominant eye averaged) and binocular reading speed was not significant. A significant difference in reading speed was found between binocular and the non-dominant eye, as determined by the far sighting test (p = 0.03). Monocular reading showed significantly increased (8.9 per cent) fixation duration (p < 0.01) and longer regressive saccades by 0.43 character spaces (p < 0.01). Reading with the non-dominant eye, as determined by the near sighting test, showed increased progressive saccade length by 0.2 characters compared to the dominant eye (p = 0.03). No other significant differences between dominant and non-dominant eyes were found. The agreement between the faster reading eye and ocular dominance was 44 to 56 per cent depending on whether dominance was determined at near or far. Conclusion: The outcomes suggest that in subjects with normal binocular vision, there is no marked enhancement in reading performance by binocular vision when reading paragraphs of text. Furthermore, the monocular reading performance appears to be close to equal and any small differences in performance appear not to be strongly associated with ocular dominance. © 2014 Optometrists Association Australia."

This study was designed to evaluate advanced life support (ALS) emergency medical technicians' (EMTs) ability to successfully intubate a simulated airway using a video-assisted semi-rigid fiberoptic stylet, the Clarus Video System (CVS).; Methods: ALS EMTs were first shown a brief slideshow and three example videos and then given 20 min to practice intubating a mannequin using both the CVS and standard direct laryngoscopy (DL). The mannequin was then placed on the floor to simulate field intubation at the scene. Each participant was given up to three timed attempts with each technique. Endotracheal tube position was confirmed with visualization by one of the study authors. Comparisons and statistical analysis were conducted using SPSS® Statistics 21 (IBM®). Demographics and survey results were also collected and analyzed.; Results: The median total time for intubation was 15.00 s for DL and 15.50 s for CVS revealing no significant difference between the two techniques (p = 0.425), and there was no significant difference in the number of attempts required to successfully place the endotracheal tube (ETT) (p = 0.997). Demographic factors including handedness and eye dominance did not seem to affect outcomes. Participants reported a relatively high level of satisfaction with the CVS.; Conclusions: ALS EMTs were able to obtain intubation results similar to those of their usual direct laryngoscopy technique when utilizing a video-assisted semi-rigid fiberoptic stylet with very limited instruction and experience with the device.

However, little research has focused on understanding how such cross-modal action demands are coordinated, especially when conflicting information needs to be processed conjunctly in different action modalities. In two experiments, we address this issue by studying vocal responses in the context of spatially conflicting eye movements (Experiment 1) and in the context of spatially conflicting manual actions (Experiment 2, under controlled eye fixation conditions). Crucially, a comparison across experiments allows us to assess resource scheduling priorities among the three effector systems by comparing the same (vocal) response demands in the context of eye movements in contrast to manual responses. The results indicate that in situations involving response conflict, eye movements are prioritized over concurrent action demands in another effector system. This oculomotor dominance effect corroborates previous observations in the context of multiple action demands without spatial response conflict. Furthermore, and in line with recent theoretical accounts of parallel multiple action control, resource scheduling patterns appear to be flexibly adjustable based on the temporal proximity of the two actions that need to be performed. © 2014 ARVO.

In comparison to previous research, which has mainly focused on the phenomenological experience and the age distribution of retrieved events, the present study provides a novel view on the retrieval of event information by quantifying the information as semantic representations. We investigated the semantic representation of sensory cued autobiographical events and studied the modality hierarchy within the multimodal retrieval cues. The experiment comprised a cued recall task, where the participants were presented with visual, auditory, olfactory or multimodal retrieval cues and asked to recall autobiographical events. The results indicated that the three different unimodal retrieval cues generate significantly different semantic representations. Further, the auditory and the visual modalities contributed the most to the semantic representation of the multimodally retrieved events. Finally, the semantic representation of the multimodal condition could be described as a combination of the three unimodal conditions. In conclusion, these results suggest that the meaning of the retrieved event information depends on the modality of the retrieval cues. © 2013 Karlsson et al.

Material and Methods: Twenty-eight eyes of twenty-eight patients who were treated with intravitreal 0.5 mg (0.05 ml) ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech Inc., USA) for macular edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion were included in this study. The medical records were analysed retrospectively. Age, sex, laterality, systemic disorders, number of injections, follow-up period and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before and after treatment were recorded. Spectral OCT findings such as central macular thickness (CMT), type of edema, presence of IS/OS and ELM damage, vitreomacular pathologies were evaluated. Also fluorescein angiographies (FA) were analyzed in order to detect macular or peripheral ischemia. The relationship between these parameters and BCVA was analysed. Results: There were 12 males and 16 females in our study. The mean follow-up time was 12 (3-35) months. Ischemia was detected in 36% of the patients in FA. The mean number of injections was 2.8 (1-7). The mean BCVA at the end of the follow-up (0.56±0.44 logMAR) was significantly better than that at baseline (0.76±0.48 logMAR; p<0.05). The mean CMT improved from 614.6±246.6 μm at baseline to 250±171.6 μm at the end of the follow-up (p=0.000). The efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab was similar among the sub-groups which were formed considering presumed prognostic factors (p>0.05). Intact foveal IS/OS line (p=0.025) and ELM (p=0.033) at baseline correlated with good final visual outcome but the type of edema showed no difference among all sub-groups (p>0.05).

However, the event-related potential (ERP) counterparts of behavioral multisensory enhancement are not well known. We recorded ERPs and behavioral data from 14 healthy volunteers with three types of target stimuli (modality-specific, bimodal, and trimodal) to examine the spatio-temporal electrophysiological characteristics of multisensory enhancement by comparing behavioral data with ERPs. We found a strong correlation between P3 latency and behavioral performance in terms of reaction time (RT) (R = 0.98, P <0.001), suggesting that P3 latency constitutes a temporal measure of behavioral multisensory enhancement. In addition, a fast RT and short P3 latency were found when comparing the modality-specific visual target with the modality-specific auditory and somatosensory targets. Our results indicate that behavioral multisensory enhancement can be identified by the latency and source distribution of the P3 component. These findings may advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms of multisensory enhancement. © 2013 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
"Morgan-Warren P.J.; Woodcock M.";0.0;Visual aspects of advanced sensors and helmet-mounted displays;2014;Aeronautical Journal;10.1017/S0001924000009040;Visually coupled systems such as helmet mounted displays are designed to improve aircrew situational awareness by providing timely flight, targeting and other information overlaid on real or sensor-derived views of the external environment. Data can be presented in monocular, biocular or binocular fashion and are associated with visual conflicts and potential ophthalmic problems. Restricted sensor spectrum, limits of resolution, inherent system latency, the displaced visual input from remote sensors and restricted field of view may contribute to ophthalmic symptoms in aircrew. Disruption to binocularity and reliance on monocular cues for depth perception and hyperstereopsis from sensor-induced convergence disparity may cause distance estimation problems, whereas inappropriate accommodative stimuli and ocular dominance factors are common causes of eyestrain. Binocular rivalry from discordant imagery to each eye may compromise visual performance via several mechanisms. This article discusses the potential visual problems associated with visually coupled systems and the challenges of integrating complex systems with the aircrew interface.

METHODS: Conjunctival sac specimen form senile patients, who received cataract crystal implantation from December 2010 to December 2012 in our hospital, were collected and cultivated at the following 3 time points: on admission day, after the eye-drops and after the surgical eye preparation. Afterwards, a comparative analysis was made in terms based on of the following factors: age, gender, dominant eye, occupation, days for eye-drops as well as the intervention techniques. RESULTS: Factors such as age, gender, intervention technique were significantly related with the rate of bacterial culture, while factors such as occupation, dominant eye and days for pre-operative eye-drops had few effects on the final results. CONCLUSION: There are both internal factors and external factors affecting the bacterial culture. Inconjunctival sac intervention techniques play a crucial role in the bacterial culture in conjunctival sac, which deserves more attention.

Certain studies have shown that there is a correlation between manual laterality and scoliotic deviation. A full study of manual laterality needs to be paired with one for visual dominance. With the aim of physiopathological research, we have evaluated the manual and visual laterality in AIS. Methods: A retrospective study from prospective data collection is used to evaluate the distribution of eye-hand laterality (homogeneous or crossed) of 65 right thoracic AIS (mean age 14.8 ± 1.8 years; mean Cobb angle: 32.8°) and a control group of 65 sex and age-matched (mean age 14.6 ± 1.8 years). The manual laterality was defined by the modified Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. The evaluation of the visual laterality is done using three tests (kaleidoscope test, hole-in-the-card test, distance-hole-in-the-card test). Results: The group of right thoracic AIS presents a significantly higher frequency of crossed eye-hand laterality (63 %) than the control group (63 vs. 29.2 %; p < 0.001). In the AIS group, the most frequent association, within crossed laterality is ""right hand dominant-left eye dominant"" (82.9 %). There is no relationship with the Cobb angle. Conclusions: Those with right thoracic AIS show a higher occurrence of crossed eye-hand laterality. This could point physiopathological research of AIS towards functional abnormality of the optic chiasma through underuse of cross visual pathways, and in particular accessory optic pathways. It would be useful to explore this by carrying out research on AISs through neuroimaging and neurofunctional exploration. © 2014 Springer-Verlag."

The significance of eye dominance becomes a concern when designing such schemes. In this paper, in order to investigate the effect of eye dominance on the perceptual 3D video quality, a database of representative asymmetric stereoscopic sequences is prepared and the overall 3D quality of these sequences is evaluated through subjective experiments. Experiment results showed that viewers find an asymmetric video more pleasant when the view with higher quality is projected to their dominant eye. Moreover, the eye dominance changes the mean opinion quality score by 16 % at most, a result caused by slight asymmetric video compression. For all other representative types of asymmetry, the statistical difference is much lower and in some cases even negligible. © 2014 IEEE.

Experimental results were obtained using certified hardware. Recording of the surface EMG was performed using the ""Neuro-Mvp"" multipurpose computer system. Motor tasks under the control of binocular vision in the age of 5-6 years are implemented with the key role of the dominant eye. The narrowing of the visual field by means of closing the dominant eye during performance of a single manual action reduces the bioelectric activity of muscles due to the decrease in the maximum amplitude of the EMG signal, which indicates the reduction in the rate of muscles contraction. At the binocular method of sight, EMG of all studied muscle groups is characterized by the uniform bioelectric activity. When one is holding the ""Flamingo"" pose with closed eyes, disruption of the stability of the parameters of bioelectric activity takes place, which is manifested as appearing sharp bursts of the bioelectric activity in the EMG patterns. The sight space narrowing at closing the dominant eye leads to disruption of the bioelectric stability of postural muscles of the back and thigh. The sight space narrowing at closing the subdominant eye during holding the ""Flamingo"" pose leads to disruption of the bioelectric stability of postural muscles of the thigh."

Methods: The PERGs and PVEPs were recorded in healthy subjects (N = 77) according to the standards of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision, with the modification of the check size of the PERG to 0.5 degrees. This allows stimulation of the macular ganglion cells and their corresponding visual pathways in healthy subjects. RESULTS: Comparison of the averaged higher and lower response amplitudes and the shorter and longer response peak times showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in both the PERG and the PVEP parameters (median [5 to 95%]): the P50 (1.92% [0 to 5.48%]) and N95 (2.06% [0 to 13.95%]) peak times and the P50 (11.82% [1.32 to 29.93%) and N95 (9.45% [1.17 to 30.38%]) amplitudes of the PERGs and the P100 (1.04% [0 to 4.15%]) and N135 (1.96% [0 to 12.36%]) peak times and the P100 (9.86% [1.26 to 29.76%]) and N135 (11.19% [1.18 to 29.99%]) amplitudes of the PVEPs. No significant correlation was found concerning the eye dominance of the PERG and PVEP parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a significant interocular difference on PERG and PVEP recording, but this could not be ascribed to the anatomy of the retina and related visual pathways. If the difference between the eyes is not taken into account, misinterpretation may occur in a pathological process. Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Optometry.

Moreover, mental rotation of a body part is a simple method of measuring human capacity for motor imagery. Previous studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging have reported activity in the cerebral motor-related area when subjects view a photograph of a rotated hand. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between characteristics and mental rotation reaction time (MRT). Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gunma University. One hundred and three undergraduate students (51male and 52 female, 20.9 ±2.2 years old) participated in the study. Eighty four of them were right-handed and 19 were left-handed. Fifty nine had the right dominant eye and 44 had the left dominant eye. Thirty two photographs of a hand rotated 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees were randomly displayed on a screen. Subjects were asked to push a button when the hand indicated were presented, right or left. The subject's MRT and answer were recorded respectively. MRT were compared with different angles by one-way analysis of variance and in sex, the dominant eye and the dominant hand by unpaired t-test. The IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software was used for statistic analysis. The level of significance was set at 5%. Results: In MRT, there were significant differences in degree (180 versus 0, 90 and 270, p<0.05) and in dominant eye, although not in sex and a dominant hand (p<0.05). Discussion: The study suggested that MRT was clearly influenced by the dominant eye, not by sex and the dominant hand. In other words, information processing of the cerebral function related to the MR are different according to dominant eye.

Remapping is thought to occur through egocentric mechanisms involving an efference copy of the first saccade that is available around the time of its onset. In contrast, an exocentric representation of the second target relative to the first target, if available, can be used to directly code the second saccade vector. While human volunteers performed a modified double-step task, we examined the role of exocentric encoding in concurrent saccade planning by shifting the first target location well before the efference copy could be used by the oculomotor system.

This has led some researchers to conclude that the asynchronous experience is a manifestation of differences in neural processing time for different visual attributes. Others, however, have suggested that the asynchronous experience is due to differences in temporal markers for changes of different visual attributes. Here, two sets of bars were presented, one to each eye. Either the bars were moving or their luminance was gradually changing. Bars moved horizontally in counterphase at low frequencies along short trajectories and were presented stereoscopically, such that the horizontal movements were perceived as back-and-forth motion on a sagittal plane, or monocularly to a dominant eye, preserving a perception of the horizontal movements on a frontal plane. In a control condition, bars were stationary and their luminance was modulated. The changes in stimulus speed or luminance occurred sinusoidally. When asked to adjust the phase of one stimulus to the other to achieve synchronous perception, participants showed a constant phase offset at the lowest frequencies used. Given the absence of abrupt transitions and the presence of similar gradual turning points in our stimuli to control for attentional effects, it can be concluded that asynchronous percepts in multimodal stimuli may at least in part be a manifestation of difference in neural processing time of visual attributes rather than solely a difference in the temporal markers (transitions versus turning points). © 2015 ARVO.

We propose that the role of spatial congruency depends on the reliability of the information provided by the facilitator; if it is relatively unreliable, adding spatially congruent information can help to unify different sensory inputs to compensate for this unreliability. To test this, we examine the influence of sound location on visual detection with a non-temporal task, presumably unfavorable for sound since it is better for temporal resolution, and predict that spatial congruency should matter in this situation. We used the continuous flash suppression paradigm that makes the visual stimuli invisible to keep the relationship of sound and sight opaque. The sound is on the same depth plane as the visual stimulus (the congruent condition) or on a different plane (the incongruent condition). The target was presented to one eye with luminance contrast gradually increased and continuously masked by flashed Mondrian masks presented to the other eye until the target was released from suppression. We found that sound facilitated visual detection (measured by released-from-suppression time) in the spatially congruent condition but not in the spatially incongruent condition. Together with previous findings in the literature, it is suggested that both task type and modality determine the reliability of the information for multisensory integration and thus determine whether spatial congruency is critical. © 2014 Springer-Verlag."

The aim of this study was to simulate a vertical heterophoria and observe its influence on postural stability while in the upright stance. Fifteen healthy, young, normophoric adults (25.6 ± 3 yrs) without otoneurological or ophthalmological problems were studied. Postural stability was assessed using a force platform in the following conditions: normal vision (NV); with a 2-diopter vertical prism, lower base, on the dominant eye (PDE); with a prism on the non-dominant eye (PNDE). In all the conditions, both eyes were open. All the measurements were recorded twice, with the subject fixing a target at distance (200 cm) and close up (40 cm). In the NODP condition the results show, whatever the distance, a significant increase in the standard deviation of anterior posterior oscillations compared with the NV condition. The PDE condition increases the postural stability only with long distance sight (decrease in the surface and in the standard deviation of the lateral oscillations). The deleterious effect, in the upright stance, on the anterior posterior stability for the PNDE conditions, is attributed to a maladjusted oculomotor response. The improvement in postural stability in NODP condition in long sight could be due to the oculomotor response reducing the vertical disparity and modifying the dynamic and tonic activity of the oculomotor muscles compared with the long-sight NV condition. We therefore conclude that the VH induced experimentally can influence postural control. Moreover, the clinical use of vertical prisms even of low strength should be considered with caution because they could have complex, positive or negative effects, depending on the eye implied and the distance of the target. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The purpose of the web-based version of the full ILP analysis is to discover each student's natural learning style, by identifying the dominant eye, ear, hand, foot and brain hemisphere. This new information is used to create learning environments that will stimulate, motivate and engage students. The ILP identifies the optimal teaching styles that match the dominant learning style of one student, a group, or an entire class. The ILP instrument for adults and children over the age of 12 was administered to 143 college level education majors in the USA. Each student completed the 20-question dominant brain hemisphere instrument twice during the semester, approximately 4 weeks apart. This study used descriptive statistics that were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 using Cronbach's alpha. The results of this study indicate that the ILP questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring brain dominance in the population studied. The validity was evidenced in the form of face, content and criterion validity. © Common Ground, Deborah A. Stevens-Smith, John D. McElroy, Simon Olding, Cindy Roper.
"Takase S.; Yukumatsu S.; Bingushi K.";0.0;Perceptual dominance during binocular rivalry is prolonged by a dynamic surround;2013;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2013.09.002;We examined whether dynamic stimulation that surrounds a rival target influences perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry. We presented a rival target surrounded by dynamic random-dot patterns to both eyes, and measured dominance durations for each eye's rival target. We found that rival target dominance durations were longer when surrounds were dynamic than when they were static or absent. Additionally, prolonged dominance durations were more apparent when the dynamic surround was alternately presented between the two eyes than when it was presented simultaneously to both eyes. These results indicate that dynamic stimulation that surrounds a rival target plays a role in maintaining the current perceptual state, and causes less perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry. Our findings suggest that dynamic signals on the retina may suppress rivalry, and thus provide useful information for stabilizing perceptions in daily life. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Because human faces vary little in size, the correlation between retinal size and distance can provide depth information. As a result, adults perceive a larger face as closer than a smaller one. Although binocular information for depth provided information that the faces in our display were equidistant, under monocular viewing, no such information was provided. Rather, the size of the faces indicated that one was closer than the other. Infants are known to look longer at apparently closer objects. Therefore, we hypothesized that infants would look longer at a larger face in the monocular than in the binocular condition if they perceived depth from the size of human faces. Because the displays were identical in the two conditions, any difference in looking-behavior between monocular and binocular viewing indicated sensitivity to depth information. Results showed that 5-month-old infants preferred the larger, apparently closer, face in the monocular condition compared to the binocular condition when static displays were presented. In addition, when presented with a dynamic display, 4-month-old infants showed a stronger 'closer' preference in the monocular condition compared to the binocular condition. This was not the case when the faces were inverted. These results suggest that even 4-month-old infants respond to depth information from a depth cue that may require learning, the size of faces. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Haun A.M.; Peli E.";0.0;Binocular rivalry with peripheral prisms used for hemianopia rehabilitation;2014;Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics;10.1111/opo.12143;"Purpose: To determine the relative binocular signal strength of moving images that are peripherally viewed through a monocular field expansion prism as opposed to moving images viewed directly. We hypothesised that prism blur might make prism images predominate less than images viewed directly with the other eye. Methods: We employed the binocular rivalry paradigm to measure the relative binocular effectiveness of directly viewed vs prism images. Four normally-sighted subjects tracked the rivalrous visibility of opponent-coloured targets seen dichoptically in the same part of the retinal visual field, using monocular field expansion prisms to produce the dichoptic display. We analysed the effects of external signal strength (whether or not motion was present in either image), retinal position or eccentricity of the targets, and controlled for target saturation. Results: We found that prism images predominate less than directly viewed images. When both eyes were presented with pattern in the dichoptic display, direct-to-prism predominance was 51%:31%. When only the direct view was presented with pattern, direct-to-prism predominance was 74%:12%; when only the prism view was presented with pattern, direct-to-prism predominance was 25%:58%. Dominance durations followed established binocular rivalry rules. Conclusions: The prism image in a monocular, peripheral field expansion prism is perceptually weaker than the corresponding direct image in the other eye. However, the prism image is still seen a significant proportion of the time, especially when no moving pattern is present in the direct view. We conclude that the rivalry ratio of the prism device is sufficiently effective for clinical applications. © 2014 The College of Optometrists."

Copyright; METHODS: A retrospective study analysis of patients with pseudophakia undergoing monocular corneal inlay implantation in the non-dominant eye was performed. The inlay was implanted monocularly in the non-dominant eye of patients. Manifest refractive spherical equivalent, uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected near visual acuity, and corrected near visual acuity were evaluated. The follow-up period was 3 months.; RESULTS: Thirteen eyes from 13 patients were evaluated. Four patients underwent LASIK for improved distance acuity at the time of inlay implantation. Mean uncorrected near visual acuity improved five lines (from J10 to J4) postoperatively. Mean uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, and corrected near visual acuity remained stable and were 20/20, 20/16, and J1, respectively, before and after KAMRA implantation. Three eyes lost two lines and 1 eye lost one line of uncorrected distance visual acuity. Two eyes lost two lines and 1 eye lost 1 line of corrected distance visual acuity. Mean manifest refractive spherical equivalent changed before and after KAMRA implantation from -0.01 ± 1.07 diopters (D) (range: 2.25 to -1.88 D) to -1.12 ± 0.87 D (range: 0.25 to -2.75 D), respectively.; CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of a small aperture corneal inlay improved uncorrected near visual acuity while maintaining uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity in monofocal patients with pseudophakia. © SLACK Incorporated."

Academic-related outcome measures included a reading test (Neale Analysis of Reading Ability), visual information–processing tests (Coding and Symbol Search subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children), and a reading-related eye movement test (Developmental Eye Movement test). Performance was assessed with and without 0.75 diopters of simulated monocular hyperopic defocus (administered in a randomized order), before and after 20 minutes of sustained near work. Unilateral hyperopic defocus was systematically assigned to either the dominant or nondominant sighting eye to evaluate the impact of ocular dominance on any performance decrements.; Results: Simulated hyperopic anisometropia and sustained near work both independently reduced performance on all of the outcome measures (P < 0.001). A significant interaction was also observed between simulated anisometropia and near work (P < 0.05), with the greatest decrement in performance observed during simulated anisometropia in combination with sustained near work. Laterality of the refractive error simulation (ocular dominance) did not significantly influence the outcome measures (P > 0.05). A reduction of up to 12% in performance was observed across the range of academic-related measures following sustained near work undertaken during the anisometropic simulation.; Conclusions: Simulated hyperopic anisometropia significantly impaired academic-related performance, particularly in combination with sustained near work. The impact of uncorrected habitual anisometropia on academic-related performance in children requires further investigation. © 2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."

This was repeated with aperture diameters of 1.5 and 2.5 mm. Each day, monocular and binocular pattern-reversal Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) were recorded. Additionally, the Pulfrich effect was measured: the task of the subject was to state whether a a 2-deg spot appeared in front or behind the plane of a central cross when moved left-to-right or right-to-left on a display screen. The retinal illuminance of the dominant eye was varied using neutral density (ND) filters to establish the ND value which eliminated the Pulfrich effect for each lens. All experiments were performed at luminance levels of 5 and 30 cd/m2.Results:Interocular differences in monocular VEP latency (at 30 cd/m2) rose to about 12-15 ms and 20-25 ms when the CL aperture was 2.5 and 1.5 mm, respectively. The effect was more pronounced at 5 cd/m2 (i.e. with larger natural pupils). A strong Pulfrich effect was observed under all conditions, with the effect being less striking for the 2.5 mm aperture. No neural adaptation appeared to occur: neither the interocular differences in VEP latency nor the ND value required to null the Pulfrich effect reduced over each 7-day period of anisocoric vision.Conclusions:Small-aperture monovision produced marked interocular differences in visual latency and a Pulfrich experience. These were not reduced by adaptation, perhaps because the natural pupil diameter of the dominant eye was continually changing throughout the day due to varying illumination and other factors, making adaptation difficult. © 2013 Plainis et al.

This study explored visual experience in GSAD compared to participants with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and healthy controls using binocular rivalry. Participants were presented with dissimilar images to each eye, and the two images competed for perceptual dominance. Consistent with the hypothesis that GSAD involves a reduced visual salience for positive social cues, we found that smiling faces were dominant for significantly shorter durations in GSAD compared to GAD and controls. Contrasting with our hypothesis of greater visual salience of negative social cues, we found no difference in negative stimuli salience. These findings are consistent with the broader view that a perceiver's affective state directly influences the content of visual consciousness. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

If an object is moving, it will be reachable only within a certain time-window. In such situations, motion of the object relative to the body has to be taken into account to judge the moment at which the target becomes reachable. We know that judgments of reachability are influenced by displaced visual feedback about the position of the hand when objects are static. Here we examine whether displaced feedback of the hand also influences reachability judgments when reachability is temporally constrained because the object is moving. The task for the subjects was to intercept a virtual cube with their unseen index finger as soon as the cube was considered to be reachable. Subjects received visual feedback about the position of their index finger, but this feedback was shifted in depth by 5. cm, either away from or closer to their body. The region that was judged to be reachable was larger when feedback of the hand was shifted away from the body than when the feedback was shifted closer to the body. This effect was correlated with the spatial error committed at the interception point. We conclude that all judgments about the surrounding space are adjusted in relation to the shifted visual feedback of the hand. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

What is unclear is how much this multisensory cross-talk reflects shared shape representations versus generic semantic associations. Here, we compare several simultaneous priming conditions to isolate the potential contributions of shape and semantics in haptic-to-visual priming. Participants explored a familiar object manually (haptic prime) while trying to name a visual object that was gradually revealed in increments of spatial resolution. Shape priming was isolated in a comparison of identity priming (shared semantic category and shape) with category priming (same category, but different shapes). Semantic priming was indexed by the comparisons of category priming with unrelated haptic primes. The results showed that both factors mediated priming, but that their relative weights depended on the reliability of the visual information. Semantic priming dominated in Experiment 1, when participants were free to use high-resolution visual information, but shape priming played a stronger role in Experiment 2, when participants were forced to respond with less reliable visual information. These results support the structural description hypothesis of haptic-visual priming (Reales and Ballesteros in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 25:644-663, 1999) and are also consistent with the optimal integration theory (Ernst and Banks in Nature 415:429-433, 2002), which proposes a close coupling between the reliability of sensory signals and their weight in decision making. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

To show the distribution of ocular dominance as measured with sensory and eye sighting methods and its potential relationship with high and low contrast LogMAR visual acuity in presbyopic subjects. Method. Forty-four presbyopes (48.5 ± 3.5 years) participated in this study. Ocular dominance was determined by eye sighting (hole-in-card) and sensorial (+1.50 D lens induced blur) methods. According to the dominance detected with each method (RE: right eye or LE: left eye), patients were classified in dominance type 1 (RE/RE), type 2 (RE/LE), type 3 (LE/RE) and type 4 (LE/LE). Results. Baseline refractive error (MSE) was RE:-0.36 ± 1.67 D and LE:-0.35 ± 1.85 D (P=0.930). RE was the dominant eye in 61.4% and 70.5% of times as obtained from sensorial and sighting methods, respectively. Most frequent dominance was of type 1 (52.3%), in this case the RE showed statistically significant better distance low contrast LogMAR VA (0.04 LogMAR units) compared to the LE (P<0.05). Conclusions. The dominance was more frequent in RE in this sample. The eye sighting and sensorial methods to define ocular dominance agreed in more than half of cases. Amount of MSE was not significantly different between dominant and non-dominant eye. But in case of right dominance, the RE presented better distance low contrast VA compared to the LE. © 2013 D.

It is unclear, however, how individual variations in ocular dominance affect visual function in monovision corrections. Here, we examined the impact of sensory ocular dominance on visual performance in both traditional and modified monovision presbyopic corrections. We recently developed a binocular adaptive optics vision simulator to correct subjects' native aberrations and induce either modified monovision (1.5 D anisometropia, spherical aberration of {Thorn}0.1 and +0.4 lm in distance and near eyes, respectively, over 4 mm pupils) or traditional monovision (1.5 D anisometropia). To quantify both the sign and the degree of ocular dominance, we utilized binocular rivalry to estimate stimulus contrast ratios that yield balanced dominance durations for the two eyes. Through-focus visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were measured under two conditions: (a) assigning dominant and nondominant eye to distance and near, respectively, and (b) vice versa. The results revealed that through-focus visual acuity was unaffected by ocular dominance. Contrast sensitivity, however, was significantly improved when the dominant eye coincided with superior optical quality. We hypothesize that a potential mechanism behind this observation is an interaction between ocular dominance and binocular contrast summation, and thus, assignment of the dominant eye to distance or near may be an important factor to optimize contrast threshold performance at different object distances in both modified and traditional monovision. © 2015 ARVO.

It is still unknown, however, how the hemispheric specialization for prosody perception might arise. Two main hypotheses have been put forward. Cue-dependent hypotheses, on the one hand, propose that hemispheric specialization is driven by specialization for the non-prosody-specific processing of acoustic cues. The functional lateralization hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes that hemispheric specialization is dependent on the communicative function of prosody, with emotional and linguistic prosody processing being lateralized to the right and left hemispheres, respectively. In the present study, the functional lateralization hypothesis of prosody perception was systematically tested by instructing one group of participants to evaluate the emotional prosody, and another group the linguistic prosody dimension of bidimensional prosodic stimuli in a dichotic-listening paradigm, while event-related potentials were recorded. The results showed that the right-ear advantage was associated with decreased latencies for an early negativity in the contralateral hemisphere. No evidence was found for functional lateralization. These findings suggest that functional lateralization effects for prosody perception are small and support the structural model of dichotic listening. © 2014 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

Recent research has argued that covert attention and overt eye-movements many share a common biological limit, such that covert exogenous orienting of attention is limited to stimuli that fall within the range of possible eye movements (the effective oculomotor range: EOMR). However, this conclusion is based on a single experimental paradigm: The Posner cueing task. Here, we examine the extent to which covert spatial attention is limited to the EOMR in visual search. Exogenous attention was assessed using a feature search task and endogenous attention assessed using a conjunction search task. The tasks were performed monocularly with the dominant eye in the frontal position or abducted by 40°. In the abducted position stimuli in the temporal hemispace could be seen, but could not become the goal of a saccadic eye-movement (i.e. they were beyond the EOMR). In contrast, stimuli in the nasal hemifield remained within the EOMR. We observed a significant effect of eye-abduction on feature search, such that search was slower when targets appeared beyond the EOMR. In contrast, eye-abduction had no effect on search times during conjunction search. Set size did not interact with target location or eye-position. It is concluded that optimal covert orienting of exogenous attention in visual search is restricted to locations within the effective oculomotor range. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, a second experiment (sample 2: N = 28, Age = 14 months) indicated that visual preference in this context is influenced by an audiovisual integration processes that takes into account the presence of an interaction between people.

The shift in color appearance according to the surrounding colors is called color induction or chromatic induction; in particular, the shift in opponent color of the surround is called chromatic contrast. To investigate whether chromatic induction occurs even when the chromatic surround is imperceptible, we measured chromatic induction during interocular suppression. A multicolor or uniform color field was presented as the surround stimulus, and a colored continuous flash suppression (CFS) stimulus was presented to the dominant eye of each subject. The subjects were asked to report the appearance of the test field only when the stationary surround stimulus is invisible by interocular suppression with CFS. The resulting shifts in color appearance due to chromatic induction were significant even under the conditions of interocular suppression for all surround stimuli. The magnitude of chromatic induction differed with the surround conditions, and this difference was preserved regardless of the viewing conditions. The chromatic induction effect was reduced by CFS, in proportion to the magnitude of chromatic induction under natural (i.e., no-CFS) viewing conditions. According to an analysis with linear model fitting, we revealed the presence of at least two kinds of subprocesses for chromatic induction that reside at higher and lower levels than the site of interocular suppression. One mechanism yields different degrees of chromatic induction based on the complexity of the surround, which is unaffected by interocular suppression, while the other mechanism changes its output with interocular suppression acting as a gain control. Our results imply that the total chromatic induction effect is achieved via a linear summation of outputs from mechanisms that reside at different levels of visual processing.

The influence of the surround is generally accounted for by retinotopic center-surround organization, with the surround inhibiting signals from the center. The traditional neural account, however, cannot rule out lateral inhibition due to cortical mechanisms sensitive to object segmentation cues. Experiments here reveal that illusory contours are sufficient to separate a center from its surround. Observers adjusted the Michelson contrast of a matching disk to equal the perceived modulation depth of a central area within a surround. Both the central test and matching disk were maintained at constant luminance and modulated in-phase at 2. Hz along one chromatic axis (L/(L. +. M) or S/(L. +. M)). The center was perceptually segmented from the surround by either a physical (retinotopic separation) or illusory (cortically represented) triangle contour. Segmentation of center from surround by the illusory contour strongly attenuated the perceived modulation depth for both chromatic axes. Further, the strength of attenuation was consistently greater with the illusory than the physically segmenting triangle. This cannot be accounted for by retinal center-surround antagonism; instead it points to a cortical neural representation of contours, with lateral inhibition following neural mechanisms sensitive to object segmentation cues. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."
"Platonov A.; Goossens J.";0.0;Eye dominance alternations in binocular rivalry do not require visual awareness;2014;Journal of Vision;10.1167/14.11.2;Binocular rivalry provides a valuable means to study how sensory processing gives rise to subjective experiences because it involves a changing percept without any change in the visual stimulus. An important question, however, is whether visual awareness is necessary for binocular rivalry to emerge. To address this question, we presented conflicting random dot motion stimuli in the two eyes at luminance contrasts around perceptual threshold. We asked subjects to report continuously, via button presses, if they noticed any kind of motion in the display (be it coherent or not) and indicate which direction of motion they thought was dominant at any given instant even if they were unaware of any motion in the display.We biased the competition between the two dichoptic stimuli by changing the motion coherence in one eye while keeping it fixed in the other to test if this induced predictable changes in rivalry dynamics.We also probed the strength of the interocular suppression. Our data show that binocular rivalry continues even if subjects claim complete absence of visual motion awareness. This remarkable dissociation between visually guided behavior and visual awareness resembles the dissociation seen in other phenomena, such as blindsight and visual masking. Fluctuations in awareness that did occur were temporally linked to the dominance switches in a manner that is consistent with adaptation reciprocal-inhibition models of binocular rivalry. © 2014 ARVO.

In this study we investigated the role of binocular cues to motion in depth. Using stimuli containing only non-stationary cues to stereomotion, we measured sensitivity across the visual field and identified areas of significant impairment in stereomotion processing in over 50% of otherwise healthy observers. These impairments vary idiosyncratically in extent and location between observers. We established that these impairments occur for a variety of visual stimuli, as long as they share the property that stimulus motion is exclusively defined by interocular and velocity differences. We tested for concordant impairments at relatively early stages along the visual pathway, i.e. changes in sensitivity across the visual field to local eye-dominance, monocular motion or instantaneous binocular disparity. Although we find variability in sensitivity across the visual field of our observers for all visual tasks, this variability across visual field locations did not correlate with the impairments in stereomotion processing. We therefore conclude that these stereomotion scotomas are due to impaired processing of dynamic cues after the stage of binocular combination. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
"Platonov A.; Goossens J.";0.0;Influence of Contrast and Coherence on the Temporal Dynamics of Binocular Motion Rivalry;2013;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0071931;"Levelt's four propositions (L1-L4), which characterize the relation between changes in ""stimulus strength"" in the two eyes and percept alternations, are considered benchmark for binocular rivalry models. It was recently demonstrated that adaptation mutual-inhibition models of binocular rivalry capture L4 only in a limited range of input strengths, predicting an increase rather than a decrease in dominance durations with increasing stimulus strength for weak stimuli. This observation challenges the validity of those models, but possibly L4 itself is invalid. So far, L1-L4 have been tested mainly by varying the contrast of static stimuli, but since binocular rivalry breaks down at low contrasts, it has been difficult to study L4. To circumvent this problem, and to test if the recent revision of L2 has more general validity, we studied changes in binocular rivalry evoked by manipulating coherence of oppositely-moving random-dot stimuli in the two eyes, and compared them against the effects of stimulus contrast. Thirteen human observers participated. Both contrast and coherence manipulations in one eye produced robust changes in both eyes; dominance durations of the eye receiving the stronger stimulus increased while those of the other eye decreased, albeit less steeply. This is inconsistent with L2 but supports its revision. When coherence was augmented in both eyes simultaneously, dominance durations first increased at low coherence, and then decreased for further increases in coherence. The same held true for the alternation periods. The initial increase in dominance durations was absent in the contrast experiments, but with coherence manipulations, rivalry could be tested at much lower stimulus strengths. Thus, we found that L4, like L2, is only valid in a limited range of stimulus strengths. Outside that range, the opposite is true. Apparent discrepancies between contrast and coherence experiments could be fully reconciled with adaptation mutual-inhibition models using a simple input transfer-function. © 2013 Platonov, Goossens."

In Experiment 1, we used the preferential looking method to investigate whether 3-8-month-old infants can discriminate illusory and non-illusory contour figures, and found that the 7-8-month-old, but not the 3-6-month-old, infants showed significant preference for illusory contour with phase difference.

With an increase in neuronal activity, blood flow increases, causing an increase in blood oxygenation, leading to an increase in transverse relaxation rate T2*. This increase in blood flow is slow and highly variable and shows a considerable spatial heterogeneity. In spite of these limitations, the hemodynamic response has been proven to be exquisitely sensitive to subtle differences in neuronal activity in time, over space, and between subjects. This paper is a brief review of my Keynote address describing some of the effort coming from my group that further demonstrates methods to robustly extract ever more information from both resting state fMRI and activation-induced fMRI. Specifically, I discuss 1) our new method to use multi-echo fMRI time series data collection to separate blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal from non-BOLD signal, 2) activation of the whole brain obtained using a simple task and, importantly massive averaging and a model-free analysis approach, and 3) fMRI decoding of left vs right eye ocular dominance column activation with a timing offset as low as 100 ms. © 2013 SPIE.

Study Design: Dental eruption pattern along with eye, ear, hand and foot lateralism were examined on 131 children between 6 to 8 years old from public schools from a multietnic population area of Barcelona city. Statistic methods (Statgraphics Plus 5.1 program) were used to evaluate data recollected.; Results: Only foot and dentition lateralities behave as independent variables regarding hand laterality. So dental eruption laterality (along with the foot one) would be one of the parameters more related to hand laterality given that dentition variable relationship is greater that the foot one. This suggests that tooth eruption could be more clinically relevant. Crossed laterality hand-foot is significantly more predominant in men (13%) than in women (1,6%). Meanwhile, the relationship between hand and dentition didn't show any influence of sex.; Conclusions: Dental eruption order, can be used as a good parameter in the determination of the patient's laterality. © Medicina Oral S.

The present study examined the effects of removal of a visible and invisible fixation point on the saccadic gap effect and the manual gap effect. Participants were required to fixate a central fixation point and respond to a peripherally presented target as quickly and accurately as possible by making a saccade (Experiment 1) or pressing a corresponding key (Experiment 2). The fixation point was dichoptically presented, and visibility was manipulated by using binocular rivalry and continuous flash suppression technique. In both saccade and key-press tasks, removing the visible fixation strongly quickened the responses. Furthermore, the invisible fixation, which remained on the display but suppressed, significantly delayed the saccadic response. Contrarily, the invisible fixation had no effect on the manual task. These results indicate that partially different processes mediate the saccadic gap effect and the manual gap effect. In particular, unconscious processes might modulate an oculomotor-specific component of the saccadic gap effect, presumably via subcortical mechanisms. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Methods: A total of 12 (5 males and 7 females; mean age: 21.3 ï¿½1.7) healthy university students, 5 and 7 of whom were right- and left-eye dominant, respectively, performed a mental rotation task, and their reaction times, numbers of gazes, and target regions were recorded using an eye-mark recorder. During the task, an image of a hand was presented, and the students inferred the side of the hand from it. Results: The reaction time was shorter and number of gazes was lower in the left- compared to right-eye dominant group. The reaction time was correlated with the total number of gazes in each target region; the lower the number of gazes, the shorter the reaction time. There were no marked differences in the target region between the 2 groups. On analysis using the VAS, no correlation was observed between the difficulty/fatigue level and reaction time/dominant eye. Discussion: The dominant eye markedly influenced the visual recognition of objects, suggesting that visual information processing in the brain, rather than visual input, is responsible for differences between right- and left-eye dominant groups."

To better understand the relationship between dichoptic masking in normal vision and suppression in amblyopia we address three questions: First, what is the time course of dichoptic masking in normals and amblyopes? Second, is interocular suppression low-pass or band-pass in its spatial dependence? And third, in the above two regards, is dichoptic masking in normals different from amblyopic suppression? METHODS. We measured the dependence of dichoptic masking in normal controls and amblyopes on the temporal duration of presentation under three conditions; monocular (the nontested eye-i.e., dominant eye of normals or nonamblyopic eye of amblyopes, being patched), dichoptic-luminance (the nontested eye seeing a mean luminance-i.e., a DC component) and dichoptic-contrast (the nontested eye seeing high-contrast visual noise). The subject had to detect a letter in the other eye, the contrast of which was varied. RESULTS. We found that threshold elevation relative to the patched condition occurred in both normals and amblyopes when the nontested eye saw either 1/f or band-pass filtered noise, but not just mean luminance (i.e., there was no masking from the DC component that corresponds to a channel responsive to a spatial frequency of 0 cyc/deg); longer presentation of the target (corresponding to lower temporal frequencies) produced greater threshold elevation. CONCLUSIONS. Dichoptic masking exhibits similar properties in both subject groups, being lowpass temporally and band-pass spatially, so that masking was greatest at the longest presentation durations and was not greatly affected by mean luminance in the nontested eye. © 2014 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."

The purpose of the web-based version of the ILP analysis is to discover each student's natural learning style, by identifying the dominant eye, ear, hand, foot and brain hemisphere. This information is used to create learning environments that stimulate, motivate and engage students. The ILP identifies the optimal teaching styles that match the dominant learning style of one student, a group, or an entire class. The idea that one side of the brain may be dominant in controlling movements of hands, feet, eyes, and ears, and that individuals have a preference that informs how they move and learn, impacts the educational environment. A sampling of the data that has been collected to validate the ILP will be used to demonstrate the vast amount of information that can be acquired from the ILP reports and on-line assessment. The instrument has the potential to provide a connection between the side of the body we favor for seeing, hearing, touching, and moving and the way we think, learn, work, play, and relate to others. © Common Ground, Deborah A.

Through processes of growth, branching and retraction these axons establish stereotypic patterns of connectivity. In the visual system, these patterns include retinotopic organization and the segregation of individual axons onto different subsets of target neurons based on the eye of origin (ocular dominance) or receptive field type (ON or OFF). Characteristic disruptions to these patterns occur when neural activity or guidance molecule expression is perturbed. In this paper we present a model that explains how these developmental patterns might emerge as a result of the coordinated growth and retraction of individual axons and synapses responding to position-specific markers, trophic factors and spontaneous neural activity. This model derives from one presented earlier (Godfrey et al., 2009) but which is here extended to account for a wider range of phenomena than previously described. These include ocular dominance and ON-OFF segregation and the results of altered ephrinA and EphA guidance molecule expression. The model takes into account molecular guidance factors, realistic patterns of spontaneous retinal wave activity, trophic molecules, homeostatic mechanisms, axon branching and retraction rules and intra-axonal signaling mechanisms that contribute to the survival of nearby synapses on an axon. We show that, collectively, these mechanisms can account for a wider range of phenomena than previous models of retino-tectal development. © 2014 Godfrey, Swindale.

Amblyopia is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of spatiotemporal visual processing that also affects oculomotor and manual motor function. We investigated the effects of amblyopia on short-term visuomotor adaptation using a saccadic adaptation paradigm. Methods. A total of 8 patients with anisometropic amblyopia and 11 visually-normal controls participated. Saccadic adaptation was induced using a double-step paradigm that displaced a saccadic visual target (at ±19°) back toward central fixation by 4.2° during the ongoing saccade. Three test blocks, preadaptation, adaptation, and postadaptation, were performed sequentially while participants viewed binocularly and monocularly with the amblyopic and fellow eyes (nondominant and dominant eyes in controls) in three separate sessions. The spatial and temporal characteristics of saccadic adaptation were measured. Results. Patients exhibited diminished saccadic gain adaptation. The percentage change in saccadic gain was lower in patients during amblyopic eye and binocular viewing compared to controls. Saccadic latencies were longer, and saccadic gains and latencies were more variable in patients during amblyopic eye viewing. The time constants of adaptation were comparable between controls and patients under all viewing conditions. Conclusions. The short-term adaptation of saccadic gain was weaker and more variable in patients during amblyopic eye and binocular viewing. Our findings suggest that visual error information necessary for adaptation is imprecise in amblyopia, leading to reduced modulation of saccadic gain, and support the proposal that the error signal driving saccadic adaptation is visual. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

The asymmetry in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness between the right and left eyes in healthy subjects has been reported in several studies, and the reason for this structural difference between right and left eyes is unclear. In the manuscript, we hypothesized that the characteristics of ocular dominance are reflected in the RNFL profile and may be related to inter-ocular structural differences between right and left eyes. In this study, ocular dominance occurred mostly in right eyes (right vs. left: 78.77% vs. 21.22%; P<. 0.001). According to ocular dominance and laterality, different relationships between the inferior and superior RNFLs were observed. The right eyes had a thicker RNFL, except in the superior quadrant, than the left eyes. Regardless of laterality, inferior RNFL was thicker than superior RNFL in the dominant eyes.

"Platonov A.; Goossens J.";0.0;The role of lateral inhibition in binocular motion rivalry;2013;Journal of Vision;10.1167/13.6.12;It is generally believed that percept alternations in binocular rivalry result from the interplay between mutual inhibition and slow adaptation of the competing percepts. This view is supported by growing evidence that dynamic changes in adaptation indeed support percept alternations in binocular rivalry. Empirical evidence for the involvement of mutual inhibition, however, is still scarce. To fill this gap, we presented human subjects with dichoptic random-dot motion stimuli and manipulated the angle between the monocular directions of motion from pure opponent horizontal motion to pure vertical motion in the same direction.We hypothesized that this decrease in motion-direction disparity increases the cross-inhibition gain due to lateral inhibition between neurons in the brain that are coarsely tuned to adjacent directions of visual motion, which predicts the largest changes in dominance at the smallest instead of the largest motion-direction disparities. We found that decreasing the angle between the two monocular directions of motion indeed systematically increased the predominance and mean dominance durations of the motion pattern presented to the ocular dominant eye (as identified by the hole-incard test). Moreover, this effect was stronger if the contrast of the stimuli was lowered. Simulations showed that these features are indeed hallmark of weighted lateral inhibition between populations of directionally tuned motion-sensitive neurons. Our findings thus suggest dominance and suppression in binocular rivalry arises naturally from this fundamental principle in sensory processing. Interestingly, if the two monocular directions of motion differed ,608, the percept alternations also included transitions to in-between (vertical) motion percepts. We speculate that this behavior might result from positive feedback arising from adapting disinhibitory circuits in the network. © 2013 ARVO.
"Zhou J.; Clavagnier S.; Hess R.F.";0.0;Short-term monocular deprivation strengthens the patched eye's contribution to binocular combination;2013;Journal of Vision;10.1167/13.5.12;Binocularity is a fundamental property of primate vision. Ocular dominance describes the perceptual weight given to the inputs from the two eyes in their binocular combination. There is a distribution of sensory dominance within the normal binocular population with most subjects having balanced inputs while some are dominated by the left eye and some by the right eye. Using short-term monocular deprivation, the sensory dominance can be modulated as, under these conditions, the patched eye's contribution is strengthened. We address two questions: Is this strengthening a general effect such that it is seen for different types of sensory processing? And is the strengthening specific to pattern deprivation, or does it also occur for light deprivation? Our results show that the strengthening effect is a general finding involving a number of sensory functions, and it occurs as a result of both pattern and light deprivation. © 2013 ARVO.

Previously, we measured discrimination of auditory, visual and audiovisual targets in people with one eye compared to controls viewing binocularly or with one eye patched. Both control groups demonstrated typical visual dominance (the Colavita effect) whereas people with one eye show no Colavita effect, and instead show equal preference for visual and auditory stimuli. Here, we loaded temporal processing in an attempt to favour audition and thereby reverse Colavita visual dominance with a modified repetition blindness paradigm. The Colavita effect was reduced for controls however, people with one eye continued to show no Colavita effect, reversed or otherwise. People with one eye display equal auditory and visual processing in this context, suggesting unbiased multisensory processing, likely as a form of cross-modal adaptation and compensation for their loss of binocularity. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Using eye tracking to enforce fixation on specific facial features, we found that the N170 was larger for fixation on the eyes compared to fixation on the forehead, nasion, nose or mouth, which all yielded similar amplitudes. This eye sensitivity was seen in both upright and inverted faces and was lost in eyeless faces, demonstrating it was due to the presence of eyes at fovea. Upright eyeless faces elicited largest N170 at nose fixation. Importantly, the N170 face inversion effect (FIE) was strongly attenuated in eyeless faces when fixation was on the eyes but was less attenuated for nose fixation and was normal when fixation was on the mouth. These results suggest the impact of eye removal on the N170 FIE is a function of the angular distance between the fixated feature and the eye location. We propose the Lateral Inhibition, Face Template and Eye Detector based (LIFTED) model which accounts for all the present N170 results including the FIE and its interaction with eye removal. Although eyes elicit the largest N170 response, reflecting the activity of an eye detector, the processing of upright faces is holistic and entails an inhibitory mechanism from neurons coding parafoveal information onto neurons coding foveal information. The LIFTED model provides a neuronal account of holistic and featural processing involved in upright and inverted faces and offers precise predictions for further testing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This phenomenon is thought to be the result of competition at a local level, where local rivalry zones interact to give rise to a single, global dominant percept. Certain perceived combinations that result from this local competition are known to last longer than others, which is referred to as grouping during binocular rivalry. In recent years, the phenomenon has been suggested to be the result of competition at both eye- and image-based processing levels, although the exact contribution from each level remains elusive. Here we use a paradigm designed specifically to quantify the contribution of eye- and image-based processing to grouping during rivalry. In this paradigm we used sine-wave gratings as well as upright and inverted faces, with and without binocular disparity-based occlusion. These stimuli and conditions were used because they are known to result in processing at different stages throughout the visual processing hierarchy. Specifically, more complex images were included in order to maximize the potential contribution of image-based grouping. In spite of this, our results show that increasing image complexity did not lead to an increase in the contribution of image-based processing to grouping during rivalry. In fact, the results show that grouping was primarily affected by the eye-of-origin of the image parts, irrespective of stimulus type. We suggest that image content affects grouping during binocular rivalry at low-level processing stages, where it is intertwined with eye-of-origin information. © 2014 Stuit et al.

The validity of this apparently counter-intuitive assertion becomes evident whenever we face noisy, feeble or ambiguous visual stimulation: in these conditions, the state of the observer may play a decisive role in determining what is currently perceived. On this background, ambiguous perception and its amenability to top-down influences can be employed as an empirical paradigm to explore the principles of perception. Here we offer an overview of both classical and recent contributions on how stable and transient states of the observer can impact ambiguous perception. As to the influence of the stable states of the observer, we show that what is currently perceived can be influenced (1) by cognitive and affective aspects, such as meaning, prior knowledge, motivation, and emotional content and (2) by individual differences, such as gender, handedness, genetic inheritance, clinical conditions, and personality traits and by (3) learning and conditioning. As to the impact of transient states of the observer, we outline the effects of (4) attention and (5) voluntary control, which have attracted much empirical work along the history of ambiguous perception. In the huge literature on the topic we trace a difference between the observer's ability to control dominance (i.e., the maintenance of a specific percept in visual awareness) and reversal rate (i.e., the switching between two alternative percepts). Other transient states of the observer that have more recently drawn researchers' attention regard (6) the effects of imagery and visual working memory. (7) Furthermore, we describe the transient effects of prior history of perceptual dominance. (8) Finally, we address the currently available computational models of ambiguous perception and how they can take into account the crucial share played by the state of the observer in perceiving ambiguous displays. © 2014 Scocchia, Valsecchi and Triesch.

Amblyopia is associated with abnormal visual experience (e.g., anisometropia) during infancy or early childhood. Several studies have shown prolongation of saccadic latency time in amblyopic eye. In our opinion, study of saccadic latency in the context of central vision deficits assessment, should be based on central retina stimulation. For this reason, we proposed saccade delayed task. It requires inhibitory processing for maintaining fixation on the central target until it disappears—what constitutes the GO signal for saccade. The experiment consisted of 100 trials for each eye and was performed under two viewing conditions: monocular amblyopic/non-dominant eye and monocular dominant eye. We examined saccadic latency in 16 subjects (mean age 30 ± 11 years) with anisometropic amblyopia (two subjects had also microtropia) and in 17 control subjects (mean age 28 ± 8 years). Participants were instructed to look at central (fixation) target and when it disappears, to make the saccade toward the periphery (10◦) as fast as possible, either left or the right target. The study results have proved the significant difference in saccadic latency between the amblyopic (mean 262 ± 48ms) and dominant (mean 237 ± 45ms) eye, in anisometropic group. In the control group, the saccadic latency for dominant (mean 226 ± 32ms) and non-dominant (mean 230 ± 29ms) eye was not significantly different. By the use of LATER (Linear Approach to the Threshold with Ergodic Rate) decision model we interpret our findings as a decrease in accumulation of visual information acquired by means of central retina in subjects with anisometropic amblyopia. © 2014 Perdziak, Witkowska, Gryncewicz, Przekoracka-Krawczyk and Ober.

A predictive sequence of non-rivalrous stimuli preceded dichoptically presented rivalrous displays. One of the dichoptic images was the implied next step of the preceding sequence while the other was not. Observers reported their initial dominant percept. Across five experiments, we found that motion sequences biased perceptual selection such that a rivalrous stimulus that continued a motion sequence tended to dominate one that did not. However, signals generated by complex pattern of motion information or verbal-semantic information had no influence on selection. These results are consistent with the view that onset rivalry is an early phase of rivalry that is likely insensitive to modulation by factors originating beyond the visual system. © 2014, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

Conventionally, the dominant eye is adjusted for distant vision. There may be needed to do inversely (crossed monovision). Purpose : To compare conventional and crossed monovision in pseudophakic eyes. Cases and Method : This study was made on 27 patients who were inserted with intraocular lens (IOL) in both eyes. One group of 17 cases received conventional and the other group of 10 cases received crossed monovision. Each case was evaluated for visual acuity at various distances, near stereopsis, patient satisfaction, and use of eyeglasses. Results : Ten cases of crossed monovision showed less satisfactory findings regarding near stereopsis and visual acuity at middle distance than 17 cases of conventional monovision. Both groups showed similar findings regarding satisfaction and use of eyeglasses. Conclusion : Crossed monovision was partially inferior to conventional one. Both methods showed similar patient satisfaction. Crossed monovision may be used in correcting presbyopia.
"Johansson J.; Seimyr G.Ö.; Pansell T.";0.0;Eye dominance in binocular viewing conditions;2015;Journal of Vision;10.1167/15.9.21;Different degrees of eye dominance may need to be considered when comparing monocular and binocular performance or estimating binocular summation effects. The purpose of this study was to explore eye dominance under binocular viewing conditions and observe gradual differences in preference. Two binocular eye-dominance tests were evaluated and compared to the hole-in-thecard sighting test. The first experiment was based on a binocular sighting test. The second originated from the variable-angle mirror test, utilizing physiological diplopia to determine which eye dominates the binocular percept. The participants were 32 healthy subject with normal sight. For both experiments there were plausible effects of different degrees of eye dominance affecting how the subjects positioned or perceived the scene. The outcomes were supported by a statistically significant correlation with an interocular difference in sensitivity to degraded visibility. A statistically significant correlation was found between the hole-in-the-card test and the variable-angle mirror test (r = 0.527, p < 0.01). The experiments confirm the plausible occurrence of forms of eye dominance under binocular viewing conditions. The correlation with the hole-in-the-card test was weak to moderate, due to factors that appear to be related to testing and viewing conditions. Interocular differences in sensitivity to blur appear to be a useful factor in further grading of eye dominance.

The mean (SD) for the AA, AF, and lag in dominant eyes was 12.48 (2.56) dioptres, 12.45 (4.83) cycles per minute, and 0.80 (0.27) dioptres respectively. The mean (SD) for the AA, AF, and lag in non-dominant eyes was 12.16 (2.37) dioptres, 12.20 (4.88) cycles per minute, and 0.83 (0.28) dioptres respectively. The mean (SD) difference in AA, AF, and lag between dominant and non dominant eyes was 0.32 (0.75) dioptres (P=0.001), 0.25 (1.05) cycles per minute (P=0.04), and -0.02 (0.11) dioptres (P=0.10) respectively. The AA and AF was statistically better (P<0.05) in the dominant eye group than in the non-dominant eye group. These data provided little evidence of any difference in the accommodative lag between dominant and non-dominant eyes (P>0.05). Conclusion: The right eye was dominant in 76% of subjects. Superior AA and AF was found in the dominant eye as determined by hole-in-the card method in young healthy adults, although these differences are perhaps not of clinical significance (<0.50 dioptres and <2 cycles per minute). © Springer-Verlag 2013.

Occlusion of the dominant eye is the primary and best treatment, although efficacy decreases after 6 years of age. As a result, levodopa/carbidopa has been explored as an adjunct to conventional therapy and has been shown to have an immediate impact on visual acuity. Several studies to date have shown mixed results on the benefit of supplementing occlusion therapy with levodopa/carbidopa, although they have primarily studied children. The authors describe the oldest patient (46 years old) documented in the literature to have shown improvement in visual acuity using levodopa/carbidopa. He was given a 16-week course at a dose in line with previous studies while being effectively occluded full time due to a glaucomatous right eye with no light perception. On 3-month follow-up, his left eye improved two lines and stabilized at 6 months. Copyright 2015, SLACK Incorporated.

However, the detection of symmetry has never been investigated in cases where input from one eye is profoundly compromised. Testing monocularly blind (MB) individuals represents a unique opportunity to investigate whether symmetry salience relies on a normally developed binocular visual system. In a visual symmetry detection task using dot patterns, congenitally MB showed comparable accuracy to normally sighted individuals viewing monocularly. This included better detection of vertically than horizontally symmetric patterns. However, the MB were slower than controls in detecting a symmetrical pattern. In a control target-detection task, no significant differences in performance were observed between these groups. Overall, normal developing binocular vision does not appear necessary for the visual system to detect the presence of visual symmetry. However, optimal detection mechanisms may be dependent on binocular summation or other processes dependent on input from both eyes. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

The present study examined whether the suppression signal is tightly linked to a specific planned saccade and if it conforms to the viewer's intention. A novel Go/No-go task was devised where participants made consecutive saccades to fixate a stimulus appearing across the screen horizontal meridian in 4° steps. At times, the features of the stimulus (colour and/or shape) were altered when it reappeared at a new location. Participants had to suppress the saccade that would otherwise leave the stimulus if its features matched instructed criteria. Saccade suppression was determined by the reduced probability for saccades towards and away from a target stimulus. Results show both correct suppression to saccades leaving the target and erroneous suppression to saccades towards it. The erroneous suppression was initially observed for any change in features but later lifted. The suppression shortened the length of saccades leaving a target but not those towards it. The initial suppression during previewing the target appears to be based on expedited but incomplete evaluation of visual stimulus, and is not linked to any specific saccade. These properties might reflect the stage of ocular decision based on which the suppression signal is generated. They also account for the phenomenon of ""peripheral-to-foveal"" effect on eye movements in reading. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

We evaluated to what extent this also applies to VEP-based objective acuity assessment, which typically uses gratings or checkerboards. Methods: Seventeen subjects with amblyopia (anisometropic and strabismic) participated in the study; decimal VA range of their amblyopic eye covered 0.03-1.0 (1.5-0.0 logMAR). Using the Freiburg Acuity VEP (FrAVEP) method, checkerboard stimuli with six check sizes covering 0.02°-0.4° were presented in brief-onset mode (40 ms on, 93 ms off) at 7.5 Hz. All VEPs were recorded with a Laplacian montage. Fourier analysis yielded the amplitude and significance at the stimulus frequency. Psychophysical VA was assessed with the Landolt-C-based automated Freiburg Visual Acuity Test (FrACT). Results: Test-retest limits of agreement for both FrACT and FrAVEP were ±0.20 logMAR. In all but two dominant eyes and high-acuity amblyopic eyes (VA <0.3 logMAR), FrACT and FrAVEP agreed within the expected limits of ±0.3 logMAR. However, the VEP-based acuity procedure overestimated single Landolt-C acuity by more than 0.3 logMAR in 9 of 17 (53 %) of the amblyopic eyes, up to 1 logMAR. While all subjects had a psychophysical acuity difference >0.2 logMAR between the dominant and amblyopic eye, only three of them showed such difference with the FrAVEP. Conclusion: Both measurements of visual acuity with the VEP and FrACT were highly reproducible. However, as expected, in amblyopia, acuity can be markedly overestimated using the VEP. We attribute this to the use of repetitive stimulus patterns (checkerboards), which also lead to overestimation in psychophysical measures. The VEP-based objective assessment never underestimated visual acuity, but needs to be interpreted with appropriate caution in amblyopia. © 2014 Springer-Verlag."

"Ito M.; Shimizu K.; Handa T.; Ishikawa H.; Niida T.";0.0;Evaluation of sensory dominance using binocular rivalry as related to ocular deviations;2015;American Orthoptic Journal;10.3368/aoj.65.1.67;Introduction and Purpose: To investigate the relationship between sensory dominance and ocular deviations. Patients and Methods: Sixty-three patients were evaluated with a new device for the measurement of exclusive visibility during binocular rivalry. The patients were consisted of twenty-three with exotropia (XT), twenty with intermittent exotropia [X(T)], twenty with exophoria (XP), respectively. Device is composed of two retinometers, their holders in which angle and position can be adjustable and a PC for data storage and analysis. In each of eyes, exclusive visibility of one stimulus during binocular rivalry was measured for 60 sec, and the strength of ocular dominance was evaluated by the difference of exclusive visibility between dominant and nondominant eye. Results: The difference of exclusive visibility time between dominant and nondominant eye were 9.8 ± 3.7 sec in the XT group, 6.1 ± 4.1 sec in the X(T) group and 2.2 ± 1.5 sec in the XP group, respectively. There were significant differences between XT and X(T) (P < 0.01) as well as between XT and XP (P <0.001). Conclusions: The present result indicates that sensory dominance was obviously influenced by ocular deviations since exclusive visibility of dominant eye was prolonged with decreasing the opportunity of normal binocular vision such as XT or X(T). © 2015 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

Methods: The study design was a prospective convenience sampling of consecutive eye clinic patients with amblyopia/amblyogenic factors and visually normal volunteers. Participants were divided into two main groups based on entry-level visual acuity using clinical methods: amblyopes (≥2 lines interocular difference) and nonamblyopes. Ocular alignment, refractive error, stereoacuity, fixation status, and retinal correspondence were determined. The change in acuity of the nondominant eye based on two types of dominant eye occlusion (translucent, lightproof) was derived from a computer-generated acuity test using staircase methodology. Results: Some participants in each main group had an interocular effect of up to 0.15 logMAR. However, both overall group means did not show an improved visual acuity with one type of occlusion compared to the other. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant increase in the magnitude of interocular effect with esodeviations and abnormal retinal correspondence. Ansiometropic and strabismic amblyopes differed, showing monocular improvements with lightproof and translucent occlusion, respectively. Conclusions: Interocular effect related to the amount of light transmission allowed by the type of occlusion over the dominant eye may differ in amblyopia subtypes and increased magnitude of effect is related to the presence of esotropia and abnormal retinal correspondence. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

There are a myriad of different factors related to clinical settings that affect these interactions and they have received less attention in nursing studies. Identifying clinical constraints that impact the nursing student-instructor relationships will help nursing instructors to manage clinical learning situations in a more effective manner. Objective: The goal of this study was to identify the primary factors that influence the student-instructor interactions within clinical settings. Methods: A purposeful sampling strategy was applied to recruit 18 nursing students and instructors to participate in qualitative, semi-structured interviews. In order to identify relevant themes of transcribed interviews, qualitative content analysis was utilized. Results: Data analysis resulted in the development of five main themes that represent essential interaction constraints in clinical contexts. These themes include: outsiders' eyes, dominance of act, close contact, clinical workplaces' disputes, and instability and uncertainty. Conclusions: The results of this study can serve to improve the understanding and practice of international clinical nursing instructors within the clinical education context.

"Johansson J.E.; Pansell T.; Ygge J.; Seimyr G.Ö.";0.0;The effect of contrast on monocular versus binocular reading performance;2014;Journal of Vision;10.1167/14.5.8;The binocular advantage in reading performance is typically small. On the other hand research shows binocular reading to be remarkably robust to degraded stimulus properties. We hypothesized that this robustness may stem from an increasing binocular contribution. The main objective was to compare monocular and binocular performance at different stimulus contrasts and assess the level of binocular superiority. A secondary objective was to assess any asymmetry in performance related to ocular dominance. In a balanced repeated measures experiment 18 subjects read texts at three levels of contrast monocularly and binocularly while their eye movements were recorded. The binocular advantage increased with reduced contrast producing a 7% slower monocular reading at 40% contrast, 9% slower at 20% contrast, and 21% slower at 10% contrast. A statistically significant interaction effect was found in fixation duration displaying a more adverse effect in the monocular condition at lowest contrast. No significant effects of ocular dominance were observed. The outcome suggests that binocularity contributes increasingly to reading performance as stimulus contrast decreases. The strongest difference between monocular and binocular performance was due to fixation duration. The findings may pose a clinical point that it may be necessary to consider tests at different contrast levels when estimating reading performance. © 2014 ARVO.

We also know that dominant limb is controlled by dominant hemisphere and limb preference is used as an indicator for hemisphere dominance. In this study we attempted to explore the hemispheric dominance by the use of three limbs (hand, foot and eye). Methods: We performed this survey on two samples, psychiatric patients compared with normal population. For this purpose, knowing that the organ dominance is stabilized in adolescence, and age has no effect on the people above 15, we used 48 high school girls and 65 boys as the final samples of normal population. The patient group included 57 male and 26 female who were chronic psychiatric patients. Results: The result shows that left-eye dominance is more in patients than the normal group(p=0.000) but the handedness and footedness differences are not significance. In psychotic, bipolar and depressive disorders, eye dominance had significant difference (P= 0.018). But this is not true about hand and foot dominance. Discussion: Our findings proved that generally in psychiatric patients, left-eye dominance is more common, left-eye dominance is also more in psychotic and depressive disorders. It is less common in bipolar disorders. Key words: hemispheric lateralization, limb dominance, mental disorders.

However, less is known about the perception of second-order moving gratings. To investigate this issue, we measured the contrast sensitivity for second-order (contrast-modulated) moving gratings in seven anisometropic amblyopes and ten normal controls. The measurements were performed with non-equated carriers and a series of equated carriers. For comparison, the sensitivity for first-order motion and static second-order stimuli was also measured. Most of the amblyopic eyes (AEs) showed reduced sensitivity for second-order moving gratings relative to their non-amblyopic eyes (NAEs) and the dominant eyes (CEs) of normal control subjects, even when the detectability of the noise carriers was carefully controlled, suggesting substantial processing deficits of motion of contrast-modulated gratings in anisometropic amblyopia. In contrast, the nonamblyopic eyes of the anisometropic amblyopes were relatively spared. As a group, NAEs showed statistically comparable performance to CEs. We also found that contrast sensitivity for static second-order stimuli was strongly impaired in AEs and part of the NAEs of anisometropic amblyopes, consistent with previous studies. In addition, some amblyopes showed impaired performance in perception of static second-order stimuli but not in that of second-order moving gratings. These results may suggest a dissociation between the processing of static and moving second-order gratings in anisometropic amblyopia. © 2014 Tang et al.

The laterality marks the extremities and the senses of one side of the body that are connected by afferent and efferent nerve pathways, with the primary motor and sensory areas of the opposite hemisphere. Laterality can be observed at the level of the upper extremity, ocular dominance, and dominance of hearing and at the level of the lower extremities. The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between senses and limbs laterality and the appearance of dyscalculia among primary school students. Methods. In our study 140 fifth-grade students from all the elementary schools in Kragujevac were involved. For the determination of the dominant laterality senses and limbs some specific questionnaires were used. Results. The results clearly show the following: dominant handedness does not affect the appearance of dyscalculia (p=1.000); upper limb gestual laterality does not affect the appearance of dyscalculia (p=0.864); laterality of the lower extremities (p=0.733), ocular dominance (p=0.121) and laterality of hearing (p=0.602) do not affect the appearance of dyscalculia; laterality affection in any segment does not affect the overall mathematics achievement test (p=0.189). Conclusion. All of the problems with laterality observed in students with learning disabilities should be processed by a team. Exercises in psychomotor reeducation program related to guidance, practicing and stabilization laterality have a great impact on reducing learning problems, especially the problems of the calculus."
"Chaumillon R.; Blouin J.; Guillaume A.";0.0;Eye dominance influences triggering action: The Poffenberger paradigm revisited;2014;Cortex;10.1016/j.cortex.2014.05.009;Our dominant eye (DE) is the one we unconsciously choose when performing a monocular task. Although it has been recognized for centuries, eye dominance and its behavioral consequences remain poorly understood. Here we used the simple and well-known Poffenberger paradigm (1912) in which participants press a button with the right or left index finger, in reaction to the appearance of a lateralized visual stimulus. By selecting participants according to their DE and handedness, we were able to decipher the impact of eye dominance on visuomotor transformation speed. We show, for the first time, that in right-handers simple reaction times (RT) in response to a lateralized visual target are shorter when it appears in the contralateral visual hemifield with respect to the DE. In left-handers, only those with a right DE exhibit a shorter RT with the left hand and they show no hemifield difference. Additionally, the Poffenberger paradigm has been used to estimate the interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) in both directions, from the right to the left hemisphere or the reverse, by comparing hand RTs following stimulation of each visual hemifield. The present study demonstrates that this paradigm leads to biased estimations of these directionally considered IHTT and provides an explanation to the often reported IHTT negative values that otherwise appear implausible. These new findings highlight the need to consider eye dominance in studies investigating the neural processes underlying visually-guided actions. More generally, they demonstrate a substantial impact of eye dominance on the neural mechanisms involved in converting visual inputs into motor commands. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The risk of severe visual impairment on the healthy eye is doubled in patients with amblyopia. If detected early enough, the chances of visual rehabilitation are good. Treatment consists of refractive correction and occlusion of the dominant eye. Patient compliance is an important factor and can be monitored using thermosensors. It was the goal of our study to give proof of the principle that the wearing times of glasses and patches can be measured using a comparatively small and commercially available microsensor. Methods: Agreement between wearing times protocols of ocular patching/refractive correction and temperature measurements of thermosensors attached to the patches or glasses of three individuals were analysed using the Bland-Altman method. It was also analysed whether blinded persons could distinguish between temperature curves of patches and glasses, or temperature curves of an incubator or while worn in a pocket. Results: The temperatures picked up by the microsensors indicate the beginning and the end wearing times of either glasses or ocular patches through steep temperature difference and a distinct temperature curve during measurements. Although blinded test persons were able to cleary distinguish between temperature profiles from incubator/pocket measurements compared to glasses/patching, glasses and patching curves could be discriminated correctly in only 50%. Differences between wearing time protocols and temperature measurements were within the limits of agreement as stated by the Bland-Altman plots. Conclusion: The TheraMon® microsensor can reliably measure wearing times of glasses and ocular patches without making the wearer uncomfortable, although the data are not unquestionable, especially in higher surrounding temperatures. Further studies on a larger number of individuals with different wearing profiles are needed. © 2013 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

"Carey D.P.; Hutchinson C.V.";0.0;Looking at eye dominance from a different angle: Is sighting strength related to hand preference?;2013;Cortex;10.1016/j.cortex.2012.11.011;Sighting dominance (the behavioural preference for one eye over the other under monocular viewing conditions) has traditionally been thought of as a robust individual trait. However, Khan and Crawford (2001) have shown that, under certain viewing conditions, eye preference reverses as a function of horizontal gaze angle. Remarkably, the reversal of sighting from one eye to the other depends on which hand is used to reach out and grasp the target. Their procedure provides an ideal way to measure the strength of monocular preference for sighting, which may be related to other indicators of hemispheric specialisation for speech, language and motor function. Therefore, we hypothesised that individuals with consistent side preferences (e.g., right hand, right eye) should have more robust sighting dominance than those with crossed lateral preferences. To test this idea, we compared strength of eye dominance in individuals who are consistently right or left sided for hand and foot preference with those who are not. We also modified their procedure in order to minimise a potential image size confound, suggested by Banks etal. (2004) as an explanation of Khan and Crawford's results. We found that the sighting dominance switch occurred at similar eccentricities when we controlled for effects of hand occlusion and target size differences. We also found that sighting dominance thresholds change predictably with the hand used. However, we found no evidence for relationships between strength of hand preference as assessed by questionnaire or by pegboard performance and strength of sighting dominance. Similarly, participants with consistent hand and foot preferences did not show stronger eye preference as assessed using the Khan and Crawford procedure. These data are discussed in terms of indirect relationships between sighting dominance, hand preference and cerebral specialisation for language and motor control. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Total of 50 students studying at Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, including 31 males (62%) and 19 females (38%), with visual acuity of 20/20 and without congenital color vision deficiency (CCVD) evaluated by Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plate test (IPPT) were recruited for this prospective comparative study upon their voluntary participation. DE was determined by the Gündogan Method. The color discrimination ability was examined with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue (FM100) test. Test was applied by two days interval to all subjects for the three times while two eyes (TE), right eye (RE) and left eye (LE) were seeing for detecting red-green (r/g), blue-yellow (b/y) local color spectral regions error scores. The error scores were evaluated for both in DE and non-dominant (NDE). P values below 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The students aged 21.18±2.52 years (mean± SD). Without sex difference the RE and the LE dominancy were found 22(44%) and 28(56%) respectively and FM 100 test total error scores of DE in both r/g-b/y regions were found without gender difference 24.12 ± 14.70, 34.68±18.95, respectively. For the NDE in both, r/gb/y regions error scores without gender difference were 32.20±19.21, 36.24±17.56, respectively. The difference of total error scores between the DE and NDE was found as 58.80 ±29.92, 68.44 ±31.46. The statistical differences among the DE and the NDE in r/g local region and total error scores were found significant in both genders (P < 0.05, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The color vision discrimination performance ability was found prominent for DE. This superiority was attributed to higher sensitivity of the r/g local color spectral region. We conclude that DE has priority in r/g color spectral region, probably including inhibition of NDE. Copyright International Journal of Ophthalmology Press.

We therefore investigated its effects in 52 right-handed (36 right-eyed and 16 left-eyed) and 51 left-handed (35 left-eyed and 16 right-eyed) schizophrenia in-patients without and with drug use. Eye dominance affected IMC in all schizophrenia patients. When comparing right- and left-handers, we found that this result was only significant in the right-handed patients and in the smaller subgroup without drug use. In the right-handers, left eye dominance—like left-handedness—was associated with higher values in IMC and less pronounced manifestation of negative symptoms, right eye dominance was not. Thus, left-eyed right-handers may be more closely related to left-handers than to right-handers. In accordance with the results from the literature, we suggest that these findings are due to better interhemispheric connections and less impairment of white matter structures, especially in right-hemispheric regions. Moreover, cannabis use was related to higher scores in IMC and less pronounced negative symptoms, but only in the right-eyed and not in the left-eyed right-handers or in the left-handers. Hence, differences in eye dominance and handedness may be partially responsible for different results in interhemispheric connections among cannabis users. In conclusion, both eye dominance and use of cannabis should be taken into account when assessing clinical symptoms in schizophrenia patients. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
Balci O.;0.0;Clinical characteristics of patients with conjunctivochalasis;2014;Clinical Ophthalmology;10.2147/OPTH.S61851;"Purpose: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with conjunctivochalasis (CCh).; Methods and materials: This retrospective study enrolled 30 subjects diagnosed with conjunctivochalasis. Complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity assessment, slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometry, dilated funduscopy, tear break-up time, Schirmer 1 test, and fluorescein staining were performed in all patients. Age, sex, laterality, ocular history, symptoms, and clinical findings were recorded.; Results: The study included 50 eyes from 30 cases. Ages ranged from 45 to 80 years, with a mean age of 65±10 years. CChs grading were as follows: 30 (60%) eyes with grade 1 CCh; 15 (30%) eyes with grade 2 CCh; and five (10%) eyes with grade 3 CCh. CCh was located in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva in 45 (90%) eyes, and in the remaining five (10%) CCh was located in the superior bulbar conjunctiva. Ten (33.3%) patients had no symptoms. Dryness, eye pain, redness, blurry vision, tired eye feeling, and epiphora were the symptoms encountered in the remaining twenty (63.6%) patients. Altered tear meniscus was noted in all cases. The mean tear break-up time was 7.6 seconds. The mean Schirmer 1 test score was 7 mm. Pinguecula was found in ten patients.; Conclusion: Dryness, eye pain, redness, blurry vision, and epiphora were the main symptoms in patients with CCh. Dryness, eye pain, and blurry vision were worsened during downgaze and blinking. So CCh should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of chronic ocular irritation and epiphora. © 2014 Balci."
"Wulff M.; Humphreys G.W.";0.0;Visual responses to action between unfamiliar object pairs modulate extinction;2013;Neuropsychologia;10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.01.004;Previous studies show that positioning familiar pairs of objects for action ameliorates visual extinction in neuropsychological patients (Riddoch, Humphreys, Edwards, Baker, & Willson, 2003). This effect is stronger when objects are viewed from a self-perspective and are placed in locations congruent with the patient's premorbid handedness (Humphreys, Wulff, Yoon, & Riddoch, 2010a), consistent with it being modulated by a motor response to the stimuli. There is also some evidence that extinction can be reduced with unfamiliar object pairs positioned for action (Riddoch et al. 2006), but the effects of reference frame and hand-object congruence have not been examined with such items. This was investigated in the present experiment. There was greater recovery from extinction when objects were action-related compared to when they were not, in line with previous studies. In addition, patients benefited more when they saw action-related pairs from a third-person than from a first-person perspective. Interestingly, on trials where extinction occurred, there was a bias reporting the 'active' object on the extinguished side-a reversal of the standard pattern of extinction-but only when objects were seen from a self-perspective. The data show that several factors contribute to the effects of action relations on attention, depending upon the familiarity of the object pairs and the reference frame that stimuli have been seen in. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For younger children, the haptic system dominates size discrimination and vision dominates orientation discrimination: the dominance may reflect sensory calibration, and could have direct consequences on children born with specific sensory disabilities. Here we measure thresholds for visual discrimination of orientation and size in children with movement disorders of upper limbs. Visual orientation discrimination was very similar to the age-matched typical children, but visual size discrimination thresholds were far worse, in all eight individuals with early-onset movement disorder. This surprising and counterintuitive result is readily explained by the cross-sensory calibration hypothesis: when the haptic sense is unavailable for manipulation, it cannot be readily used to estimate size, and hence to calibrate the visual experience of size: visual discrimination is subsequently impaired. This complements a previous study showing that non-sighted children have reduced acuity for haptic orientation, but not haptic size, discriminations (Gori, Sandini, Martinoli, & Burr, 2010). Together these studies show that when either vision or haptic manipulation is impaired, the impairment also impacts on complementary sensory systems that are calibrated by that one. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Eye-tracking studies have allowed researchers to examine which features of faces infants find most salient across development, and the present study examined scanning of familiar (i.e., mother) and unfamiliar (i.e., stranger) static faces at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Infants showed a preference for scanning their mother's face as compared to a stranger's face, and displayed increased attention to the eye region as compared to the mouth region. Infants also showed patterns of decreased attention to eyes and increased attention to mouths between 6 and 12 months. Associations between visual attention at 6, 9, and 12 months and the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales DP (CSBS-DP) at 18 months were also examined, and a significant positive relation between attention to eyes at 6 months and the social subscale of the CSBS-DP at 18 months was found. This effect was driven by infants' attention to their mother's eyes. No relations between face scanning in 9- and 12-month-olds and social outcome at 18 months were found. The potential for using individual differences in early infant face processing to predict later social outcome is discussed. © 2013 The Author(s).

Design: Randomized clinical trial. Participants: Sixty-eight eyes of 34 patients were treated with wavefront-guided LASIK and PRK. Methods: One eye was treated with LASIK and the fellow eye was treated with PRK. Eyes were randomized by ocular dominance. Patients completed a questionnaire preoperatively and at each postoperative visit evaluating symptoms of dry eye, dry eye severity, vision fluctuations, and foreign body sensation. Main Outcome Measures: Change in self-reported dry eye with secondary outcome measure of visual fluctuations and foreign body sensation scores after LASIK and PRK. Results: Both groups of eyes experienced significant increases in symptoms of dry eye, vision fluctuation, and foreign body sensation after LASIK and PRK at postoperative months 1, 3, and 6. However, by the 12-month postoperative visit, there was no increase in dry eye symptoms over the preoperative baseline levels in either group. Patients undergoing PRK experienced significantly higher levels of vision fluctuation at postoperative month 1 than those undergoing LASIK. Conclusions: Both LASIK and PRK caused an increase in dry eye symptoms and severity, vision fluctuations, and foreign body sensation over baseline in the early postoperative period. At postoperative month 1, PRK caused greater vision fluctuations than LASIK. By 1 year postoperatively, all symptoms of dry eye, vision fluctuations, and foreign body sensation returned to their baseline, preoperative levels.

van Ee R.;0.0;Percept-switch nucleation in binocular rivalry reveals local adaptation characteristics of early visual processing;2011;Journal of Vision;10.1167/11.2.1;"When the two eyes view incompatible images that subtend the entire visual field, perception alternates between the two images unpredictably: at seemingly random times and locations, observers experience sudden changes in the awareness of the unchanging visual stimulation. Here we focus on the very first spontaneous breakout from the very first suppression phase after onset of the two eyes' competing whole-field stimuli. We call such spontaneous local breakout an "" initial percept-switch nucleation."" We employed homogeneous visual input to examine where, and how, spontaneous local initial percept-switch nucleations originate, demonstrating that their spatial distribution contains locally random inhomogeneities, which are eye- and observer-dependent. We were able to predict the occurrence probability of the percept nucleations by adaptation buildup of the neurons associated with the representation of one eye's image. Intriguingly, the neuronal processes related to both cross-inhibition and local eye dominance could not predict nucleation probability; this is because nucleation inhomogeneity appeared to be different from another previously reported local inhomogeneity known as ""onset bias"" signifying the local first dominance-choice inhomogeneity upon stimulus onset. Collectively, we reveal a governing role of local adaptation in the neurons associated with early visual processing of one eye's image, in the origination of new phases in awareness. © ARVO."

In traditional asymmetric stereoscopic video coding, the quality of one of the views is reduced while the other view is of original quality. However, this approach is not fair for people with one dominant eye. We propose to address this problem by reducing the quality of horizontal slices in both views. In our approach, we applied low-pass filtering to slices of both views while the corresponding slice in the other view is untouched. Subjective tests show that the quality, sharpness and depth of the low-passed filtered stereo video are close to the original one. We tested a different number of horizontal slices and various levels of filtering for two representative video sequences. Results show that low-pass filtering of the horizontal slices of both views with smoothing on the slice edges is an effective technique for asymmetric stereoscopic videos. © 2012 IEEE.

During the critical period, preventing input from one eye results in a significant impairment of vision, and loss of cortical responsivity via the deprived eye. Residual ocular dominance plasticity has recently been observed in adulthood. Accumulating evidence suggests that OD plasticity involves N-methylD-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD). Here we report that the administration of a selective LTD antagonist prevented the ocular dominance shift during the critical period. The NMDAR co-agonist D-serine facilitated adult visual cortical LTD and the OD shift in short-term monocularly deprived (MD) adult mice. When combined with reverse suture, D-serine proved effective in restoring a contralaterally-dominated visual input pattern in long-term MD mice. This work suggests LTD as a key mechanism in both juvenile and adult ocular dominance plasticity, and D-serine as a potential therapeutic in human amblyopic subjects. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

At the molecular level, experience-dependent synaptic plasticity triggers new gene and protein expression necessary for long-lasting changes in synaptic strength.1 In particular, translation of mRNAs at remodeling synapses is emerging as an important mechanism in persistent forms of synaptic plasticity in vitro and certain forms of memory consolidation. 2 We have previously shown that sleep is required for the consolidation of a canonical model of in vivo plasticity (i.e., ocular dominance plasticity [ODP] in the developing cat).3 Using this model, we recently showed that protein synthesis during sleep participates in the consolidation process. We demonstrate that activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] pathway, an important regulator of translation initiation,4 is necessary for sleep-dependent ODP consolidation and that sleep promotes translation (but not transcription) of proteins essential for synaptic plasticity (i.e., ARC and BDNF). Our study thus reveals a previously unknown mechanism operating during sleep that consolidates cortical plasticity in vivo. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

Detection with peripheral prisms has primarily been evaluated using conventional perimetry, where binocular rivalry is unlikely to occur. We quantified detection over more visually complex backgrounds and examined the effects of ocular dominance. METHODS.: Detection rates of eight participants with HH or quadranopia and normal binocularity wearing unilateral peripheral prism glasses were determined for static perimetry targets briefly presented in the prism expansion area (in the blind hemifield) and the seeing hemifield, under monocular and binocular viewing, over uniform gray and more complex patterned backgrounds. RESULTS.: Participants with normal binocularity had mixed sensory ocular dominance, demonstrated no difference in detection rates when prisms were fitted on the side of the HH or the opposite side (p > 0.2), and had detection rates in the expansion area that were not different for monocular and binocular viewing over both backgrounds (p > 0.4). However, two participants with abnormal binocularity and strong ocular dominance demonstrated reduced detection in the expansion area when prisms were fitted in front of the non-dominant eye. CONCLUSIONS.: We found little evidence of local suppression of the peripheral prism image for HH patients with normal binocularity. However, in cases of strong ocular dominance, consideration should be given to fitting prisms before the dominant eye. Although these results are promising, further testing in more realistic conditions including image motion is needed. Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Optometry.

For example, if someone places their coffee cup on a table, then later they know where it is because they see it, but also because they remember how their reaching limb was oriented when they placed the cup. Intuitively, one would expect more accurate reaches if either of these estimates were improved (e.g., if a light were turned on so the cup were more visible). It is now well-established that the brain tends to combine two or more estimates about the same stimulus as a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), which is the best thing to do when estimates are unbiased. Even in the presence of small biases, relying on the MLE rule is still often better than choosing a single estimate. For this work, we designed a reaching task in which human subjects could integrate proprioceptive and allocentric (landmark-relative) visual information to reach for a remembered target. Even though both of these modalities contain some level of bias, we demonstrate via simulation that our subjects should use an MLE rule in preference to relying on one modality or the other in isolation. Furthermore, we show that when visual information is poor, subjects do, indeed, combine information in this way. However, when we improve the quality of visual information, subjects counter-intuitively switch to a sub-optimal strategy that occasionally includes reliance on a single modality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, only a very limited number of stereoscopic image quality assessment metrics was proposed through the years. In this paper, we propose a new no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment algorithm based on the nonlinear additive model, ocular dominance model, and saliency based parallax compensation. Our studies using the Toyama database result in three valuable findings. First, quality of the stereoscopic image has a nonlinear relationship with a direct summation of two monoscopic image qualities. Second, it is a rational assumption that the right-eye response has the higher impact on the stereoscopic image quality, which is based on a sampling survey in the ocular dominance research. Third, the saliency based parallax compensation, resulted from different stereoscopic image contents, is considerably valid to improve the prediction performance of image quality metrics. Experimental results confirm that our proposed stereoscopic image quality assessment paradigm has superior prediction accuracy as compared to state-of-The-Art competitors. © 2012 Ke Gu et al.

The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the ability of patient-reported measures of vision to quantify the perceptual effects of defocus. Methods: Ten young (18-35 years) subjects rated their subjective visual performance monocularly on 3 scales following wear of their optimal monocular distance correction and nine different blurring lenses (-0.50 to +1.50 in 0.25. D steps) in a trial frame. The three scales used were a 0-100 numeric rating scale (NRS), a 100. mm visual analog scale (VAS), and a 5 point (""Poor"", ""Fair"", ""Average"", ""Good"", ""Excellent"") categorical rating scale (CRS). Results: Mixed linear modeling results found no significant effects either for eye or trial number, but did find a significant effect due to blurring lens power (p<. 0.0001), with ratings decreasing with increasing levels of blur for all scales. Results were not significantly different between the NRS and VAS at any level of blur, with limits of agreement falling within 22% of the measurement scale. CRS ratings were about 15 units lower than the other scales on average, with limits of agreement that varied with lens power and were roughly 3 times as large. Across scale internal consistency was 0.94. Conclusions: The NRS and VAS yield virtually identical rating responses, but both differing slightly, however from the CRS. Each scale successfully discriminated levels of blur smaller than 0.25. D with only a single measurement. © 2012 British Contact Lens Association."
"Balslev D.; Newman W.; Knox P.C.";0.0;Extraocular muscle afferent signals modulate visual attention;2012;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;10.1167/iovs.12-10249;PURPOSE. Extraocular muscle afferent signals contribute to oculomotor control and visual localization. Prompted by the close links between the oculomotor and attention systems, it was investigated whether these proprioceptive signals also modulated the allocation of attention in space. METHODS. A suction sclera contact lens was used to impose an eye rotation on the nonviewing, dominant eye. With their viewing, nondominant eye, participants (n=4) fixated centrally and detected targets presented at 5° in the left or right visual hemifield. The position of the viewing eye was monitored throughout the experiment. As a control, visual localization was tested using finger pointing without visual feedback of the hand, whereas the nonviewing eye remained deviated. RESULTS. The sustained passive rotation of the occluded, dominant eye, while the other eye maintained central fixation, resulted in a lateralized change in the detectability of visual targets. In all participants, the advantage in speed and accuracy for detecting right versus left hemifield targets that occurred during a sustained rightward eye rotation of the dominant eye was reduced or reversed by a leftward eye rotation. The control experiment confirmed that the eye deviation procedure caused pointing errors consistent with an approximately 28 shift in perceived eye position, in the direction of rotation of the nonviewing eye. CONCLUSIONS. With the caveat of the small number of participants, these results suggest that extraocular muscle afferent signals modulate the deployment of attention in visual space. © 2012 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

In this study, we investigated whether direct gaze facilitates the recognition of three-dimensional face images in infants. We presented artificially produced face images in rotation to 6-8. month-old infants. The eye gaze of the face images was either direct or averted. Sixty-one sequential images of each face were created by rotating the vertical axis of the face from frontal view to ±30°. The recognition performances of the infants were then compared between faces with direct gaze and faces with averted gaze. Infants showed evidence that they were able to discriminate the novel from familiarized face by 8. months of age and only when gaze is direct. These results suggest that gaze direction may affect three-dimensional face recognition in infants. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

There is insufficient evidence, however, for distinguishing between the efficacies of different rehabilitation techniques. The objective of this study is to verify whether there are differences between two instrumental vestibular rehabilitation techniques, computerised dynamic posturography (CDP) and optokinetic stimulation (OKN), in order to establish the optimal strategy for each patient. We conducted a prospective, comparative study of the two techniques (CDP and OKN) in patients with instability due to chronic unilateral peripheral vestibular disorder. We randomly included 12 patients in each group, performing the evaluation with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and the CDP with the sensorial organisation test (SOT), rhythmic weight shift and limits of stability (LOS). We found a statistically significant improvement in both groups in average balance score according to the SOT. In the OKN group, however, improvement was greater in visual preference. The CDP group showed greater benefits in the visual and vestibular input and LOS. Patients with poor vestibular and visual input or with reduced LOS will benefit more from an exercise protocol with CDP. Patients with poor visual preference, however, are ideal candidates for rehabilitation with OKN. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

Prior adaptation to one of the two monocular stimuli is known to affect initial dominance in the subsequent dichoptic presentation. In the present work, we have used three different types of adaptation in order to investigate how each one affects initial dominance during BR. In the first adaptation type, adapting to a stimulus identical to the one used during rivalry has led to its consequent suppression, verifying previous findings. The binocular presentation which we have used excludes the possibility of eye-adaptation, suggesting that it is the specific stimulus that the brain adapts to. In the second adaptation type, we find suppression effects following adaptation to stimuli belonging to the same category (face or house) but are different from the specific ones used in the following BR presentation. In the final adaptation type, in which the words ""face"" or ""house"" are used as adaptors, no statistically significant effect was found. These results suggest that perceptual selection can be directly influenced by the prior presentation of visual stimuli different to the ones used during BR, and thus support a higher-level, cognitive influence on the latter. © 2012 Pelekanos, Roumani and Moutoussis."

In the present study we show that what we are holding in working memory (WM) can bias the way we perceive ambiguous structure from motion stimuli. Holding in memory the percept of an unambiguously rotating sphere influenced the perceived direction of motion of an ambiguously rotating sphere presented shortly thereafter. In particular, we found a systematic difference between congruent dominance periods where the perceived direction of the ambiguous stimulus corresponded to the direction of the unambiguous one and incongruent dominance periods. Congruent dominance periods were more frequent when participants memorized the speed of the unambiguous sphere for delayed discrimination than when they performed an immediate judgment on a change in its speed. The analysis of dominance time-course showed that a sustained tendency to perceive the same direction of motion as the prior stimulus emerged only in the WM condition, whereas in the attention condition perceptual dominance dropped to chance levels at the end of the trial. The results are explained in terms of a direct involvement of early visual areas in the active representation of visual motion in WM. © 2013 Scocchia et al.

The current study investigates the effect of deprivation due to severe impairment in one eye during late childhood or adulthood, on the spatial performance of the fellow 'good' eye. Methods: Twenty patients (age: 29 ± 9 years) with severe visual impairment in one eye (visual acuity equal or worse than count fingers at 1 m), for a period longer than 2 years, participated in the study. Only patients with an age less than 50 years and monocular deprivation onset greater than 9 years were included. On the basis of the time of deprivation the patients were categorised into two subgroups: (i) long-past deprivation (N = 8, age 28 ± 8 years, 9-20 years of deprivation) and recent deprivation (N = 12, age 30 ± 11 years, 2-4 years of deprivation). Eighteen more participants (age: 28 ± 5 years) with normal binocular vision served as the control group. Best-corrected contrast sensitivity was evaluated using reversing (2 Hz) vertical sinusoidal gratings. Seven spatial frequencies (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 c/deg) were tested. Performance of the control group was tested both monocularly (dominant eye) and binocularly. Results: In normal subjects, binocular viewing improved contrast sensitivity on average by 4.2 dB (corresponding to a 70% improvement in contrast threshold) compared to monocular recordings. Average contrast sensitivity in subjects with impaired vision in one eye was found to be higher by 5.0 dB (corresponding to an 83% improvement in contrast threshold) compared with the dominant eye of the control group. The increase in sensitivity was independent of spatial frequency. No differences were observed between the two subgroups with recent and long-past deprivation. Conclusions: Notable improvement in contrast sensitivity was found in the non-pathological eye of patients with severe impairment in the other eye at an age after the ""critical"" period of visual development. These findings are consistent with growing evidence supporting functional changes as a result of altered experience or injury in the adult vision system. © 2013 The College of Optometrists."

Design: Retrospective case series. Participants: Thirty-five patients out of 500 with scleritis. Methods: We reviewed the electronic health records of 500 patients with scleritis, 35 of whom were diagnosed with herpes virus infection, seen at 2 tertiary referral centers. We studied the clinical features and ocular complications of this subset of patient with scleritis. Main Outcome Measures: Correlation between classification, severity, and symptoms (i.e., pain) and diagnosis of herpetic-associated scleritis. Vision loss, presence of associated uveitis, keratitis, glaucoma, or systemic disease were documented over the follow-up period. Other outcome measures included epidemiologic data: age, gender, laterality, visual acuity, duration of symptoms, and underlying systemic or ocular diseases.

Thirty-five (74.4%) of these were diagnosed with herpes virus infection, 5 (10.6%) with tuberculosis, and the remaining 7 (14.8%) with other infectious disease. Patients with herpes-associated scleritis were analyzed as a group and then compared with those with idiopathic scleritis. Most patients with herpetic scleritis presented with acute (85.7%) and unilateral (80%) scleral inflammation. Pain was moderate or severe in 68.6% of the patients. The most common type of scleritis was diffuse anterior in 80% (n = 28), followed by nodular anterior 11.4% (n = 4), and necrotizing in 8.6% (n = 3). Necrotizing anterior scleritis was more commonly seen in patients with herpetic scleritis versus patients with idiopathic disease (8.6% vs 1.2%; P<0.05). Unilaterality was also more common in herpetic scleritis (80%) than in idiopathic disease (56.7%; P<0.05). Vision loss was significantly greater in herpetic than idiopathic scleritis (34.3% vs 11.5%; P<0.001). Conclusions: The association between scleritis and infectious disease may be higher than previously reported by other series. Herpes viruses account for 7% of all scleritis cases and its diagnosis may be challenging when there is not a classically diagnostic clinical picture. We present the observed clinical features of herpetic scleritis and describe the clinical differences at presentation between patients with idiopathic scleritis and those with herpes infection.

"Yang D.-M.; Hu Z.-L.; Hu M.";0.0;Application of atropine in treatment of amblyopia in old children;2013;International Eye Science;10.3980/j.issn.1672-5123.2013.03.22;Amblyopia is the most common eye disease affecting children's visual development. Amblyopia patients not only monocular or binocular visual acuity decreased significantly, and the loss of binocular vision and stereopsis, seriously affect the visual development. For three hundred years, patching as the classic treatment of amblyopia therapy is widely used in clinical. Patching of the sound eye, not only is not conducive to the establishment of a binocular stereopsis, but also easy to form amblyopia. On the other hand, although age is the impact of amblyopia treatment effect of important factors, but the patients' adherence to treatment efficacy is also crucial. For these reasons, the occlusion therapy for older children with amblyopia cure rate and treatment is subject to the appropriate constraints. Therefore, atropine penalization therapy is widely accepted by some patients, especially older monocular amblyopia children. It can give children a forced to comply with the treatment process and can suppress the dominant eye to eyes depending on the material, in order to facilitate the establishment of binocular vision. And the treatment method to effectively solve the problems covered by the patients because of cosmetic or other reasons do not want to accept.

In binocular rivalry the two eyes receive conflicting images, but only one of them is consciously perceived at a time. Here we search for the neural sites of the competitive interactions underlying this phenomenon by testing whether neural pattern activity occurring before stimulus presentation can predict the initial dominant percept in binocular rivalry and, if so, where in the brain such predictive activity is found. Subjects were scanned while viewing an image of a face in one eye and an image of a house in the other eye with anaglyph glasses. The rivalrous stimulus was presented briefly for each trial, and the subject indicated which of the two images he or she preferentially perceived. Our results show that BOLD fMRI multivariate pattern activity in the fusiform face area (FFA) before the stimulus is presented predicts which of the two images will be dominant, suggesting that higher extrastriate areas, such as the FFA, are not only correlated with, but may also be involved in determining the initial dominant percept in binocular rivalry. Furthermore, by examining pattern activity before and after trial onset, we found that pre-trial activity in the FFA for the rivalrous face trials is no more similar to the post-trial activity for the non-rivalrous face trials than to that for the non-rivalrous house trials, indicating a dissociation between neural pattern information, which predicts a given state of awareness, and mean responses, which reflect the state of awareness ultimately achieved. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: In 100 healthy young volunteers, rightward- tilted and leftward- tilted square- wave gratings were presented to the right and left eye, respectively. A newly designed chart employing balancing techniques based on binocular rivalry was used in conjunction with a viewer. Target contrast in the nondominant eyes was fi xed at 100%, while in the dominant eyes it was varied from 100% to 10% during ten steps that used a square- wave grating of 2 cycles per degree and which were 4o in size. By varying the contrast of the dominant eye, a ""reversal point,"" which is where the exclusive visibility time or the conscious perception frequency of the nondominant eye exceeds the dominant eye, is revealed. This can be used to assess the magnitude of the ocular dominance. Results: Ocular dominance magnitude results indicated there was a good correlation between the modifi ed and original balancing techniques. The modifi ed balancing technique also showed high measurement repeatability. Conclusions: A chart that uses the modifi ed balancing technique for ocular dominance examinations can be used as a simple test to quantify ocular dominance within clinical settings. © 2012 Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System, American Orthoptic Journal."

METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized, unmasked clinical trial was performed. Patients with age-related cataract who were to undergo phacoemulsification were divided into two groups: multifocal intraocular lens (MIOL) vs monofocal intraocular lens (SIOL). 10 patients were included in each group. In the group of MIO L, patients got implantation of ReZoom NXGl MIOL in the dominant eye and ReSTOR SA60D3 MIOL in the fellow eye while patients in the group of SIOL got implantation of Sensar AR40e IOL bilaterally. One month postoperatively, distance, mid-range and near visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, focal depth were measured. Satisfaction of visual quality was investigated by questionnaire. RESULTS: One month postoperatively, the patients in the MIOL group were satisfied with distance visual acuity, meanwhile they achieved better mid-range and near visual acuity compared with patients in the SIOL group. Under mesopia condition, SIOL implantation gave better contrast sensitivity in spatial frequency at 3 cpd, and no difference was observed in other spatial frequency, while under photopia condition, no significant difference was observed among all the five types of spatial frequency. The focal depth of MIOL was 5.30 D, which was significantly higher than 2.85D of the SIOL. Satisfaction of visual quality of near and mid-range was significantly higher in the MIOL group. CONCLUSION: Customized implantation of intraocular lens after phacoemulsification provides better visual acuity and visual quality postoperatively. Copyright 2013 by the IJO Press.

Evidence is mixed concerning the relationship between stability of ocular dominance and reading deficits. Contrasting results may be due to the use of different tests of dominance, different samples of readers, and different scoring methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship among ocular dominance, general visual abilities, and reading performance, and to evaluate the consistency and reliability of different tests of ocular dominance and the effects of different types of eye dominance scoring. Methods. In a group of young adults, we measured: (a) main optometric parameters; (b) reading time and accuracy; and (c) ocular dominance in two sighting and four motor tests. Dominance was determined using different scoring methods (relative, absolute, and binary scores). Results. All dominance tests showed good levels of internal reliability. Sighting tests were consistent regardless of the scoring method, and all participants had stable dominance. Three of four motor tests were moderately consistent when dominance was measured with relative scores but not when it was measured with absolute or binary scores. No relationship was found between stability of dominance and reading performance, regardless of the type of test or scoring method. No systematic pattern of correlation was found between binocular vision variables and dominance measures. Purpose. Choosing the type of motor test to measure ocular dominance is crucial, because the level of consistency among tests is low to moderate. Furthermore, motor tests were not correlated with reading performances. Present results suggest caution when trying to link reading difficulties with specific profiles of ocular dominance.

The advantage of binocular over monocular vision was also investigated. Methods: Twelve young volunteers, with an average age of 27 ± 5 years, participated in the study. LogMAR Visual Acuity (VA) was measured under cycloplegia for a range of defocus levels (from +3.0 to -3.0 D, in 0.5 D steps) with no correction and with three aspheric MFCLs (Air Optix Aqua Multifocal) with a centre-near design, providing correction for 'Low', 'Med' and 'High' near demands. Measurements were performed for all combinations of the following conditions: (1) artificial pupils of 6 and 3 mm diameter, (2) binocular and monocular (dominant eye) vision. Depth-of-focus (DOF) was calculated from the VA vs defocus curves. Ocular aberrations under cycloplegia were measured using iTrace. Results: VA at -3.0 D defocus (simulating near performance) was statistically higher for the 3 mm than for the 6 mm pupil (p = 0.006), and for binocular rather than for monocular vision (p < 0.001). Similarly, DOF was better for the 3 mm pupil (p = 0.002) and for binocular viewing conditions (p < 0.001). Both VA at -3.0 D defocus and DOF increased as the 'addition' of the MFCL correction increased. Finally, with the centre-near MFCLs a linear correlation was found between VA at -3.0 D defocus and the wearer's ocular spherical aberration (R2 = 0.20 p < 0.001 for 6 mm data), with the eyes exhibiting the higher positive spherical aberration experiencing worse VAs. By contrast, no correlation was found between VA and spherical aberration at 0.00 D defocus (distance vision). Conclusions: Both near VA and depth-of-focus improve with these MFCLs, with the effects being more pronounced for small pupils and for binocular rather than monocular vision. Coupling of the wearer's ocular spherical aberration with the aberration profiles provided by MFCLs affects their functionality. © 2012 The College of Optometrists.

In this study, we measured eye movement in healthy infants with a preference gaze problem, particularly eye movement between two face stimulations. We used the eye tracker system (Tobii1750, Tobii Technologies, Sweden) to measure eye movement in infants. Subjects were 17 3-month-old infants and 16 4-month-old infants. The subjects looked two types of face stimulation (upright face/scrambled face) at the same time and we measured their visual behavior (preference/looking/eye movement). Our results showed that 4-month-old infants looked at an upright face longer than 3-month infants, and exploratory behavior while comparing two face stimulations significantly increased. In this study, 4-month-old infants showed a preference towards an upright face. The numbers of eye movements between two face stimuli significantly increased in 4-month-old infants. These results suggest that eye movements may be an important index in face cognitive function during early infancy. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.
"Murata A.; Hayami T.; Akiyama T.";0.0;Fundamental research on three-dimensional pointing movement in consideration of change of X-And Z-Axis rotation angles;2013;Proceedings of the SICE Annual Conference;0;With the widespread of touch - panel interface, there are many pointing tasks that requires us to touch a target with a finger-tip. In such a situation, the touch-panel display is not necessarily installed parallel to the frontal or coronal plane. Possibly, it is installed at various locations with different installation angles in a three-dimensional space. Fitts' law models a one-dimensional movement. The pointing movement is, in nature, three-dimensional. However, few studies have made an attempt to model pointing movements in a three-dimensional space. In order to obtain insight into three-dimensional modeling of pointing movement, it was explored how X- And Z- Axis rotation angles affected the pointing time. The effects of eye dominance on pointing movement were also examined. As a result, it tended that the pointing time got shorter under some conditions of X- And Z-Axis rotation especially when the movement of arm was conducted within area of the preferred hand.

No studies to date have looked at improvement of multifocal visually evoked potentials (mfVEP) after lowering IOP. Methods: This was a prospective study of twenty consecutive patients with elevated IOP seen in the glaucoma department of Wills Eye Institute. Patients who met the inclusion criteria for this study had a complete eye examination including IOP measurement and underwent testing with mfVEP, Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph (HRT) and static achromatic automated perimetry with SITA-Standard 24-2 program Humphrey visual field (HVF) studies at baseline and 2 h post-IOP reduction. A minimum of 30% IOP reduction was required. IOP changes were then compared with various parameters of mfVEP, HRT and HVF using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Results: The Spearman rank correlation values between change in IOP versus various parameters were calculated: Accumap severity index (ASI), 0.37 (p = 0.14); Accumap superior hemifield, 0.049 (p = 0.85); Accumap inferior hemifield, 0.030 (p = 0.91); HVF mean deviation, 0.081 (p = 0.76); HRT rim area, 0.17 (p = 0.51); HRT cup area, -0.006 (p = 0.98).

To investigate the impact on visual performance of modifying monovision with monocularly induced spherical aberration (SA) to increase depth of focus (DoF), thereby enhancing binocular through-focus visual performance. METHODS. A binocular adaptive optics (AO) vision simulator was used to correct both eyes' native aberrations and induce traditional (TMV) and modified (MMV) monovision corrections. TMV was simulated with 1.5 diopters (D) of anisometropia (dominant eye at distance, nondominant eye at near). Zernike primary SA was induced in the nondominant eye in MMV. A total of four MMV conditions were tested with various amounts of SA (±0.2 and ±0.4 μm) and fixed anisometropia (1.5 D). Monocular and binocular visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) at 10 cyc/deg and binocular summation were measured through-focus in three cyclopledged subjects with 4-mm pupils. RESULTS. MMV with positive SA had a larger benefit for intermediate distances (1.5 lines at 1.0 D) than with negative SA, compared with TMV. Negative SA had a stronger benefit in VA at near. DoF of all MMV conditions was 3.5 ± 0.5 D (mean) as compared with TMV (2.7 ± 0.3 D). Through-focus CS at 10 cyc/deg was significantly reduced with MMVas compared to TMV only at intermediate object distances, however was unaffected at distance. Binocular summation was absent at all object distances except 0.5 D, where it improved in MMV by 19% over TMV. CONCLUSIONS. Modified monovision with SA improves through-focus VA and DoF as compared with traditional monovision. Binocular summation also increased as interocular similarity of image quality increased due to extended monocular DoF. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

To design a simple viewing system allowing dichoptic masking, and to validate this system in adults and children with normal vision. Methods. A Trial Frame Apparatus (TFA) was designed to evaluate interocular interaction. This device consists of a trial frame, a 1 mmpinhole in front of the tested eye and a full or partial occluder in front of the non-tested eye. The difference in visual function in one eye between the full- and partial-occlusion conditions was termed the Interaction Index. In experiment 1, low-contrast acuity was measured in six adults using five types of partial occluder. Interaction Index was compared between these five, and the occluder showing the highest Index was used in experiment 2. In experiment 2, low-contrast acuity, contrast sensitivity, and alignment sensitivity were measured in the non-dominant eye of 45 subjects (15 older adults, 15 young adults, and 15 children), using the TFA and an existing well-validated device (shutter goggles) with full and partial occlusion of the dominant eye. These measurements were repeated on 11 subjects of each group using TFA in the partial-occlusion condition only. Repeatability of visual function measurements using TFA was assessed using the Bland-Altman method and agreement between TFA and goggles in terms of visual functions and interactions was assessed using the Bland-Altman method and t-test. Results. In all three subject groups, the TFA showed a high level of repeatability in all visual function measurements. Contrast sensitivity was significantly poorer when measured using TFA than using goggles (p ≥ 0.05). However, Interaction Index of all three visual functions showed acceptable agreement between TFA and goggles (p < 0.05). Conclusions. The TFA may provide an acceptable method for the study of some forms of dichoptic masking in populations where more complex devices (e.g., shutter goggles) cannot be used. © 2012 American Academy of Optometry.

When inaccuracies occur repeatedly, both an immediate motor correction and a progressive adaptation of the motor command can unfold. Of all the movements in the motor repertoire of humans, saccadic eye movements are the fastest. Due to the high speed of saccades, and to the impairment of visual perception during saccades, a phenomenon called ""saccadic suppression"", it is widely believed that the adaptive mechanisms maintaining saccadic performance depend critically on visual error signals acquired after saccade completion. Here, we demonstrate that, contrary to this widespread view, saccadic adaptation can be based entirely on visual information presented during saccades. Our results show that visual error signals introduced during saccade execution-by shifting a visual target at saccade onset and blanking it at saccade offset-induce the same level of adaptation as error signals, presented for the same duration, but after saccade completion. In addition, they reveal that this processing of intra-saccadic visual information for adaptation depends critically on visual information presented during the deceleration phase, but not the acceleration phase, of the saccade. These findings demonstrate that the human central nervous system can use short intra-saccadic glimpses of visual information for motor adaptation, and they call for a reappraisal of current models of saccadic adaptation. © 2013 Panouillères et al."

In this study the possible relationships among handedness, eye dominance, and crossed hand-eye dominance in patients with different addictions mentioned above are investigated. Methods: Thirty three patients with cigarette, 35 patients with alcohol, 133 patients with heroin, 117 patients with hashish, 13 patients with drug addictions and 102 age matched controls were included in the study. Six of 13 patients with drug addictions were addicted to diazepam, 5 to pethidine and 2 to clonazepam. The patient group included 307 men and 24 women who ranged in age from 15 to 70 years. Handedness was ascertained by using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Eye dominance was measured only by the near-far alignment test.

METHODS: A retrospective, noncomparative case series included 296 eyes from 148 consecutive emmetropic patients with presbyopia who were treated with LASIKinduced micro-monovision. The CRS-Master software was used to generate ablation profiles for the MEL 80 excimer laser (Carl Zeiss Meditec) and flaps were created using the VisuMax femtosecond laser (Carl Zeiss Meditec). The target refraction was plano for distance eyes (dominant eye) and between -1.00 and -1.88 diopters (D) for near eyes. Patients were followed for 1 year. Emmetropia was defined for inclusion as spherical equivalent refraction ≥-0.88 D, sphere ≤+1.00 D, and cylinder ≤1.25 D. Median patient age was 55 years (range: 44 to 65 years). Median follow-up was 12.9 months. RESULTS: Mean deviation from intended correction was +0.02±0.35 D, with 91% within ±0.50 D and 100% within ±1.00 D. Of distance eyes, 95% achieved uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 20/20 or better and 100% achieved 20/32 or better. Binocularly, 98% of patients achieved UDVA of 20/20 or better and 100% achieved 20/32 or better; 96% achieved uncorrected near visual acuity of J2 and 99% could read J3 or better. No eyes lost 2 or more lines of corrected distance visual acuity. An average increase of 0.05 logMAR was noted in distance-corrected near visual acuity. A small increase occurred in mesopic contrast sensitivity (CSV-1000, VectorVision Inc) at 3 cycles per degree (cpd) (P=.016) and no change at 6, 12, or 18 cpd.

Researchers have attempted to modulate these biases using prism adaptation in both healthy and patient populations. Recent research suggests that prisms themselves might not be necessary; simply interacting with one side of space can produce similar effects (Dupierrix, Alleysson, Ohlmann and Chokron (2008). Brain Research, 1214, 127-135). Here we tested whether sensori-motor interaction with the environment affects aspects of cognition that should at first glance appear to be unrelated. While previous research involved tasks that were largely directional in nature (e.g., line bisection), we chose a task without a directional component, the hierarchical figures task (Navon, (1977). Cognitive Psychology, 9, 353-383). In a sample of healthy young adults, we found that after 5. min of lateralized pointing (pointing solely to the left or right side of space), performance on the hierarchical figures task varied significantly as a function of pointing direction: interference from irrelevant global information increased after interacting with the left side of space and decreased after interacting with the right side of space. We discuss the results in relation to a ""hemispheric imbalance"" hypothesis. Our findings demonstrate that cognition can be readily influenced by interactions with the environment even without artificially distorting normal perceptuo-motor relationships. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Methods: In a cross-over study design, 22 presbyopic patients (age range 50 to 64 years) were evaluated using artificial pupil contact lens on the non-dominant eye and monovision. After 1 month, binocular distance visual acuity (BDVA), binocular near visual acuity (BNVA), defocus curve, binocular distance contrast sensitivity, binocular near contrast sensitivity, and stereoacuity were measured, under photopic conditions (85 cd/m 2), in each patient after contact lens fitting. Moreover, BDVA and binocular distance contrast sensitivity were examined under mesopic conditions (5 cd/m 2). Results: Average artificial pupil contact lens and monovision BDVA were 0.02 ± 0.04 and 0.00 ± 0.09 logMAR for photopic conditions, and 0.16 ± 0.06 and 0.13 ± 0.12 logMAR for binocular near visual acuity under mesopic conditions, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between the two types of lenses at distance for both lighting levels (p > 0.05), but there were, however, significant differences at intermediate distances and near vision (p < 0.05). Binocular distance contrast sensitivity revealed statistically significant differences between artificial pupil contact lens and monovision for 1.5 cycles per degree (cpd) under photopic conditions, and 12 and 18 cpd under mesopic conditions (p < 0.05), respectively. Statistically significant differences for all spatial frequencies except for 1.5 cpd were found at near vision (p < 0.05). The mean values of stereoacuity obtained for artificial pupil contact lens (221 ± 32 sec arc) were slightly worse than for monovision correction (210 ± 49 sec arc), and statistically significant differences were not found (p = 0.23). Conclusions: Monovision performed better than an artificial pupil contact lens of the same material for near visual acuity and near contrast sensitivity. Only, the artificial pupil contact lens provides better intermediate visual acuity. Copyright © 2012 American Academy of Optometry.

Materials and Methods: The study included 37 males diagnosed with autistic disorder and 121 healthy males, all aged 4-18 years. The length of the index and ring fingers of both handsfrom the proximal bend of the metacarpophalangeal joint to the fingertipswas measured with digital calipers and the index-ring finger (2D:4D) ratio was determined. The distance between hair whorls, their perpendicular distance from the mid-sagittal line, and their direction of rotation were calculated in the autism and control groups. Hand, foot, and eye dominance were determined in both groups. The findings were evaluated using SPSS v.15.0. Results: The autism group had a greater number of hair whorls than the control group. The distance between hair whorls and the mid-sagittal line was longer in those with left hand and left eye dominance. A significant difference in the 2D:4D ratio of the right and left hands between the 2 groups was not observed. Conclusion: The autism group had more hair whorls than the control group and the hair whorls in the autistic individuals with left hand and left eye dominance were located further from the mid-saggital line. We think that these novel findings might contribute to the determination of the phenotypic features specific to autism.
"Meng Q.; Cui D.; Zhou K.; Chen L.; Ma Y.";0.0;Advantage of hole stimulus in rivalry competition;2012;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0033053;Mounting psychophysical evidence suggests that early visual computations are sensitive to the topological properties of stimuli, such as the determination of whether the object has a hole or not. Previous studies have demonstrated that the hole feature took some advantages during conscious perception. In this study, we investigate whether there exists a privileged processing for hole stimuli during unconscious perception. By applying a continuous flash suppression paradigm, the target was gradually introduced to one eye to compete against a flashed full contrast Mondrian pattern which was presented to the other eye. This method ensured that the target image was suppressed during the initial perceptual period. We compared the initial suppressed duration between the stimuli with and without the hole feature and found that hole stimuli required less time than no-hole stimuli to gain dominance against the identical suppression noise. These results suggest the hole feature could be processed in the absence of awareness, and there exists a privileged detection of hole stimuli during suppressed phase in the interocular rivalry. © 2012 Meng et al.

Despite the emergence of modern fast food, traditional SF persists worldwide, but the relationship of SF consumption with overall health, well-being, and obesity is unknown. Methods. This is an observational, cross-sectional study. The study was performed in Palermo, the largest town of Sicily, Italy. Two groups were identified: consumers of SF (n = 687) and conventional restaurant food (RES) consumers (n = 315). Study subjects answered a questionnaire concerning their health conditions, nutritional preferences, frequency of consumption of SF and a score relative to SF consumption ranging from 0 to 20 was calculated. Results: Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was significantly and independently correlated with the score of street food consumption (r = 0,103; p < 0.002). The prevalence of different diseases, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and the use of medications did not differ between the two groups. Milza (a sandwich stuffed with thin slice of bovine spleen and lung) consumers had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (12.2% vs 6.2% in non consumers; p < 0.005) and in this subgroup the use of anti-hypertensive drugs was inversely correlated with the frequency of milza consumption (r = 0.11; P = 0.010). Conclusions: This study suggests that SF consumption in Palermo is associated with a higher BMI and higher prevalence of hypertension in milza consumers. Further studies should evaluate whether frequent SF consumers have unfavourable metabolic and cardiovascular profile. © 2011 Buscemi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

While the main sequence linear increase in peak velocities as a function of saccade amplitude is well documented, our results provide demonstrations of violations of the main sequence. Peak velocities during monocular presentation were considerably higher toward temporal than nasal stimuli. This nasal-temporal asymmetry (NTA) was not explained by amplitude differences and was most pronounced for the lowest amplitudes tested, decreasing with increased amplitude. Under binocular presentation, this NTA was much smaller. While the exact reasons for this difference in peak velocities between hemifields are unclear at present, we propose that anatomical NTAs result in stronger signals from the nasal, than temporal retina leading to higher peak velocities into the temporal visual hemifield. NTAs in peak velocity are consistent with NTAs in attentional choice and in attentional function, which might also be explained by anatomical NTA. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Visual orientation toward remembered or visible visual targets requires binocular gaze shifts that are accurate in direction (version) and ocular distance (vergence). We determined the accuracy of combined version and vergence movements and the contribution of the abducting and adducting eye during gaze shifts toward memorized and visual targets in three-dimensional space. Methods. Subjects fixated either a ""far"" (94 cm) or ""near"" (31 cm) fixation light-emitting diode (LED) placed in front of the left eye. Next, in the memory-guided experiment, a target LED was lit for 80 ms (13 cm to the left or right and at 45 cm viewing distance). Subjects were instructed to make a saccade to the (remembered) target LED location. In the visually guided experiment, the target LED remained illuminated during the task. In both conditions, gaze shifts consisted of version and vergence movements. Results. Visually guided gaze shifts had both a fast intrasaccadic and a slow postsaccadic vergence component and were most accurate. During memory-guided gaze shifts, the abducting eye was more accurate than the adducting eye. Distance correction was achieved by slow postsaccadic vergence of the adducting eye. Memory-guided gaze shifts that required convergence lacked an intrasaccadic vergence component and were less accurate compared to memory-guided gaze shifts that required divergence. Conclusions. Visually guided binocular gaze shifts are faster and more accurate than memory-guided binocular gaze shifts. During memory-guided gaze shifts, the abducting eye has a leading role, and an intrasaccadic vergence enhancement during convergence is reduced. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."

To define a correct rehabilitation program for neurological patients who have impairment in these skills, there is a need for simple and cost-effective tools to determine which of the visual-motor system levels of organization are compromised by neurological lesions. In their 1995 book, The Visual Brain in Action (Oxford: Oxford University Press), AD Milner and MA Goodale proposed the existence of two pathways for the processing of visual information, the ""ventral stream"" and ""dorsal stream,"" that interact in movement planning and programming. Beginning with this model, our study aimed to validate a method to quantify the role of the ventral and dorsal streams in perceptual and visual-motor skills. Subjects and methods: Nineteen right-handed healthy subjects (mean age 22.8 years ± 3.18) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were recruited. We proposed that a delayed pointing task, a distance reproduction task, and a delayed anti-pointing task could be used to assess the ventral stream, while the dorsal stream could be evaluated with a grasping task and an immediate pointing task. Performance was recorded and processed with the video-analysis software Dartfish ProSuite. Results: Results showed the expected pattern of predominance of attention for the superior left visual field, predominance of the flexor tone in proximal peri-personal space arm movements, tendency toward overestimation of short distances, and underestimation of long distances. Conclusion: We believe that our method is advantageous as it is simple and easily transported, but needs further testing in neurologically compromised patients. © 2013 Chiappedi et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd."

Methods: From September in 2010 to March in 2011, 19 cases of anisometropic amblyopic patients (19 amblyopic eyes as group AM and 19 their sound eyes as group AS) and 19 cases of subjects with normal corrected visual acuities (19 dominant eyes as group ND and 19 non-dominant eyes as group NN) were recruited from the outpatient clinic at Tianjin Eye Hospital. A high-speed eye-movement recording system was used to monocularly record the fixational eye-movements of subjects' both eyes. A Matlab routine was used to detect and analyze the microsaccadic components of eye-movement waveforms. The microsaccadic amplitudes, peak velocities, occurrence rates, inter-microsaccadic intervals, cumulative probabilities of all groups were analyzed and compared using Origin8.0 and Matlab2008 statistics toolbox. Results: The mean microsaccadic amplitude of group AM (0.76 ± 0.07)° was larger than groups AS, ND and NN (F = 49.95, P = 0.000). The mean peak velocity of group AM (79.72 ± 5.64)°/s was faster than groups AS, ND and NN (F = 4.93, P = 0.004). The mean occurrence rate of group AM (1.52 ± 0.08) Hz was less than groups AS, ND and NN (F = 120.39, P= 0.000). The mean inter-microsaccadic interval of group AM (537.40 ± 65.47) ms was longer than groups AS, ND and NN (F=4.41, P =0.007). The amplitude dependent cumulative probability curve of group AM shifted to right compared with other groups and its amplitude 0.67° ± 0.06° at half cumulative probability was obviously increased compared with other groups (F = 203.05, P = 0.000). Conclusion: Microsaccadic amplitude, peak velocity, occurrence rate, inter-microsaccadic interval and cumulative probability could be used as the parameters for objective and quantitative evaluation of eye-movement function in amblyopia. High-speed eye-movement recording could provide useful assistance in evaluation of eye-movements in amblyopic patients. Copyright © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

We have addressed this important issue in a large cohort of 653 subjects divided into five distinct age groups, [20;30[, [30;40[, [40;50[, [50;60[and [60;[. We applied a broad range of psychophysical tests, testing distinct levels of the visual hierarchy, from local processing to global integration, using simple gratings (spatial contrast sensitivity -CS- using high temporal/low spatial frequency or intermediate spatial frequency static gratings), color CS using Landolt patches, moving dot stimuli (Local Speed Discrimination) and dot patterns defining 3D objects (3D Structure from Motion, 3D SFM). Aging data were fitted with linear or quadratic regression models, using the adjusted coefficient of determination (R2a) to quantify the effect of aging. A significant effect of age was found on all visual channels tested, except for the red-green chromatic channel. The high temporal low spatial frequency contrast sensitivity channel showed a mean sensitivity loss of 0.75 dB per decade (R2a = 0.17, p<0.001), while the lower intermediate spatial frequency channel showed a more pronounced decrease, around 2.35 dB (R2a = 0.55, p<0.001). Concerning low-level motion perception, speed discrimination decreased 2.71°/s (R2a = 0.18, p<0.001) and 3.15°/s (R2a = 0.13, p<0.001) only for short presentations for horizontal and oblique meridians, respectively. The 3D SFM task, requiring high-level integration across dorsal and ventral streams, showed the strongest (quadratic) decrease of motion coherence perception with age, especially when the task was temporally constrained (R2a = 0.54, p<0.001). These findings show that visual channels are influenced by aging into different extent, with time presenting a critical role, and high-level dorso-ventral dominance of deterioration, which accelerates with aging, in contrast to the other channels that show a linear pattern of deterioration. © 2013 Mateus et al."

Recently, Awasthi, Friedman, and Williams (2011) reported fast categorisation of faces at periphery, arguing for primacy of low spatial frequency (LSF) information in face processing. However, previous studies have also documented rapid categorization of places and natural scenes. Here, we tested if the LSF advantage is face specific or also involved in place perception. We used visually guided reaching as a continuous behavioral measure to examine the processing of LSF and high spatial frequency (HSF) hybrids, presented at the periphery. Subjects reached out and touched targets and their movements were recorded. The trajectories revealed that LSF interference was both 95. ms earlier and stronger for faces than places and was lateralized to the left visual field. The early processing of LSF information supports the assumption that faces are prioritised and provides a (neural) framework for such specialised processing. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: In a cross-over study at the University of Valencia, 22 presbyopic patients were evaluated using an artificial pupil fitted on the non-dominant eye and the simultaneous vision PureVision Multifocal contact lenses. After one month of contact lens wear, binocular distance visual acuity (BDVA), binocular near visual acuity (BNVA), defocus curve, binocular distance contrast sensitivity, binocular near contrast sensitivity, and stereoacuity were measured, under photopic conditions (85cd/m2). In addition, binocular distance visual acuity and binocular distance contrast sensitivity were examined under mesopic conditions (5cd/m2). Results: Mean binocular distance visual acuity for pinhole and PureVision Multifocal were 0.02 ± 0.04 and 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR under photopic conditions and 0.16 ± 0.06 and 0.12 ± 0.04 logMAR for binocular near visual acuity under mesopic conditions, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between both types of lenses at distance for both lighting levels and intermediate distances (p > 0.05). There was a significant difference at near vision under photopic conditions (p = 0.03). Binocular distance contrast sensitivity revealed statistically significant differences between the pinhole system and PureVision Multifocal for six and 12cpd (cycles per degree) spatial frequencies at the two luminance levels, while for near vision, differences were also significant for 18cpd. Stereoacuity was better with PureVision Multifocal (127 ± 49.3 seconds of arc) compared with the pinhole lens (220.2 ± 32.3 seconds of arc, p = 0.004). Conclusion: Pinhole and PureVision Multifocal contact lenses provide good binocular vision for distance and functional intermediate vision. Although it was better with the PureVision Multifocal, near vision was not satisfactory for either of the two contact lens options. © 2012 The Authors.

Patients and methods: In this study 25 patients with slight hyperopia and presbyopia underwent femtosecond laser correction in the non-dominant eye. Mesotest II measurements (OCULUS Optikgeräte, Wetzlar, Germany) were performed with and without glare at each of four different contrast levels preoperatively as well as 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively. Data were compared using the Wilcoxon-test with a level of significance of p & 0. 05. Results: After 24 months the median CS decreased from 1:2 to 1:2. 7 without glare and from 1:23 to 0 with glare. Of all patients 36% showed loss in CS without and 52% with glare and CS did not show any statistically significant differences between the treated and the untreated fellow eyes after 12 and 24 months. Overall 9 out of 18 monocular treated patients showed no binocular night driving ability according to the recommendations of the German Society of Ophthalmology (DOG) and the Professional Association of German Ophthalmologists (BVA) 24 months following INTRACOR. Conclusions: INTRACOR can lead to a slight reduction of mesopic contrast sensitivity and an increase of glare sensitivity. Possible consequences on night driving ability should be discussed with the patients prior to treatment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
"Pastukhov A.; Braun J.";0.0;Cumulative history quantifies the role of neural adaptation in multistable perception;2011;Journal of Vision;10.1167/11.10.1;Neural adaptation plays an important role in multistable perception, but its effects are difficult to discern in sequences of perceptual reversals. Investigating the multistable appearance of kinetic depth and binocular rivalry displays, we introduce cumulative history as a novel statistical measure of adaptive state. We show that cumulative historyVan integral of past perceptual states, weighted toward the most recent statesVsignificantly and consistently correlates with future dominance durations: the larger the cumulative history measure, the shorter are future dominance times, revealing a robust effect of neural adaptation. The characteristic time scale of cumulative history, which may be computed by Monte Carlo methods, correlates with average dominance durations, as expected for a measure of neural adaptation. When the cumulative histories of two competing percepts are balanced, perceptual reversals take longer and their outcome becomes random, demonstrating that perceptual reversals are fluctuation-driven in the absence of adaptational bias. Our findings quantify the role of neural adaptation in multistable perception, which accounts for approximately 10% of the variability of reversal timing. © ARVO.
"Baker D.H.; Meese T.S.";0.0;Interocular transfer of spatial adaptation is weak at low spatial frequencies;2012;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2012.05.002;Adapting one eye to a high contrast grating reduces sensitivity to similar target gratings shown to the same eye, and also to those shown to the opposite eye. According to the textbook account, interocular transfer (IOT) of adaptation is around 60% of the within-eye effect. However, most previous studies on this were limited to using high spatial frequencies, sustained presentation, and criterion-dependent methods for assessing threshold. Here, we measure IOT across a wide range of spatiotemporal frequencies, using a criterion-free 2AFC method. We find little or no IOT at low spatial frequencies, consistent with other recent observations. At higher spatial frequencies, IOT was present, but weaker than previously reported (around 35%, on average, at 8. c/deg). Across all conditions, monocular adaptation raised thresholds by around a factor of 2, and observers showed normal binocular summation, demonstrating that they were not binocularly compromised. These findings prompt a reassessment of our understanding of the binocular architecture implied by interocular adaptation. In particular, the output of monocular channels may be available to perceptual decision making at low spatial frequencies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Setting: Departments of Ophthalmology, University of Heidelberg, Germany, and Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania. Design: Clinical prospective nonrandomized unmasked study. Methods: Preoperatively, cataract patients were assigned to receive bilateral +3.00 D IOLs, +4.00 D IOLs, or +3.00 D (dominant eye) and +4.00 D (nondominant eye) IOLs. Follow-up examinations were performed up to 6 months postoperatively and included refraction, visual acuity (near at 40 cm and distance), the defocus curve, contrast sensitivity, and a subjective questionnaire. Results: Fifty-two patients were enrolled. No significant differences were found in the visual acuity results (P>.05). Four to 6 months postoperatively, the following median uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected and distance-corrected near visual acuity, and corrected near visual acuity (logMAR) were found in all patients: -0.08, -0.12, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.10. Ninety-eight percent of patients reported being satisfied. The highest near peak versus the biggest intermediate decline in the median monocular defocus curves comparing +3.00 D and +4.00 D multifocal IOLs (logMAR) were 0.16 at 40 cm versus 0.22 at 33 cm (P=.24) and 0.38 at 66 cm versus 0.54 at 50 cm (P<.01).

We assessed the functioning of this mechanism-individuation-during computation of quantities in cluttered scenes by using ERP measures. Participants saw a variable number of targets (1, 3, 5, 7) presented among distracters, and reported their quantities. Results showed that the N2pc amplitude was modulated by target numerosity and reached a plateau at five elements, in line with the supposed limit of the individuation mechanism. In addition, the N2pc asymptote varied depending on participants' enumeration efficiency, being smaller in participants with poor enumeration performance. The results indicate that computation of small quantities is based on multiple object individuation and suggest that individual neural differences during simultaneous individuation are strongly associated with enumeration performance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the special case of rivalry, where attention alternates between competing percepts, such dynamics can be measured and their determinants investigated. A recent study in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, now shows that the origins of attentional rivalry may be quite ancient. Furthermore, individual variation exists in the rate of attentional rivalry in both humans and flies, and in humans this is under substantial genetic influence. In the pathophysiological realm, slowing of rivalry rate is associated with the heritable psychiatric condition, bipolar disorder. Fly rivalry may therefore prove a powerful model to examine genetic and molecular influences on rivalry rate, and may even shed light on human cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. © 2012 Miller, Ngo and van Swinderen.
"Bhardwaj R.; O'Shea R.P.";0.0;Temporal Analysis of Image-Rivalry Suppression;2012;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0045407;During binocular rivalry, perception alternates between two different images presented one to each eye. At any moment, one image is visible, dominant, while the other is invisible, suppressed. Alternations in perception during rivalry could involve competition between eyes, eye-rivalry, or between images, image-rivalry, or both. We measured response criteria, sensitivities, and thresholds to brief contrast increments to one of the rival stimuli in conventional rivalry displays and in a display in which the rival stimuli swapped between the eyes every 333 ms-swap rivalry-that necessarily involves image rivalry. We compared the sensitivity and threshold measures in dominance and suppression to assess the strength of suppression. We found that response criteria are essentially the same during dominance and suppression for the two sorts of rivalry. Critically, we found that swap-rivalry suppression is weak after a swap and strengthens throughout the swap interval. We propose that image rivalry is responsible for weak initial suppression immediately after a swap and that eye rivalry is responsible for the stronger suppression that comes later. © 2012 Bhardwaj, O'Shea.

Here we use monocular rivalry between afterimages to explore the effects of attention on the contents of visual experience. In three experiments, we demonstrate that attended afterimages are seen for longer periods, on average, than unattended afterimages. This occurs both when a feature of the afterimage is attended directly and when a frame surrounding the afterimage is attended. The results of these experiments show that volitional attention can dramatically influence the contents of visual experience. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Exploratory data;2013;Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience;10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00006;The auditory mismatch responses are elicited in absence of directed attention but are thought to reflect attention modulating effects. Little is known however if the deviants in a stream of standards are specifically directing attention across modalities and how they interact with other attention directing signals such as emotions. We applied the well-established paradigm of left- or right-lateralized deviant syllables within a dichotic listening design. In a simple target detection paradigm with lateralized visual stimuli, we hypothesized that responses to visual stimuli would be speeded after ignored auditory deviants on the same side. Moreover, stimuli with negative valence in the visual domain could be expected to reduce this effect due to attention capture for this emotion, resulting in speeded responses to visual stimuli even when attention was directed to the opposite side by the auditory deviant beforehand. Reaction times of 17 subjects confirmed the speeding of responses after deviant events. However, reduced facilitation was observed for positive targets at the left after incongruent deviants, i.e. at the right ear. In particular, significant interactions of valence and visual field and of valence and spatial congruency emerged. Pre-attentive auditory processing may modulate attention in a spatially selective way. However, negative valence processing in the right hemisphere may override this effect. Resource allocation such as spatial attention is regulated dynamically by multimodal and emotion information processing. © 2013 Schock, Bhavsar, Demenescu, Sturm and Mathiak.

In contrast to the abundance of knowledge about how neuronal responsiveness is modified by visual experience, very little is known about the changes in the VC neural circuitry underlying the VC plasticity. In order to solve this problem, the chapter needs to know the basic operation of VC circuitry. The chapter addresses this question by using slice preparations and optical recording. The neural events produced by white matter (WM) stimulation were studied by time-lapse imaging of optical responses using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) digital video camera and using strobe illumination synchronized to WM stimulation. © 1995 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

METHODS: The amblyopia children from nursery were examined, 90 patients (114 eyes) were randomly selected for the treatment group, and 90 patients (108 eyes) were selected as control in April 2011 in Shenyang City. All of the subjects refracted with 1% atropine, then wear glasses. The dominant eye was covered if both eyes differ by more than two lines. Amblyopia patients from the hospital group were treated in hospital, while the control group in family.Visual acuity was observed and the efficacy was evaluated monthly. The follow-up lasted for 6 months. RESULTS: After 6 months' treatment, for the hospital treatment group, invalid in 0 case, improvement in 18 cases (20%), almost recovery in 72 patients (80%). For the family treatment group at 6 months invalid 9 cases (10%) (2 cases gave up training), improvement in 22 cases (73%), almost recovery in 15 cases (17%). There was a significant difference (χ2=73.77, P<0.005). CONCLUSION: For the treatment of amblyopia, children kept in the hospital for treatment is better than treated in family.

Armstrong R.A.;0.0;Statistical guidelines for the analysis of data obtained from one or both eyes;2013;Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics;10.1111/opo.12009;Purpose: Measurements obtained from the right and left eye of a subject are often correlated whereas many statistical tests assume observations in a sample are independent. Hence, data collected from both eyes cannot be combined without taking this correlation into account. Current practice is reviewed with reference to articles published in three optometry journals, viz., Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics (OPO), Optometry and Vision Science (OVS), Clinical and Experimental Optometry (CEO) during the period 2009-2012. Recent findings: Of the 230 articles reviewed, 148/230 (64%) obtained data from one eye and 82/230 (36%) from both eyes. Of the 148 one-eye articles, the right eye, left eye, a randomly selected eye, the better eye, the worse or diseased eye, or the dominant eye were all used as selection criteria. Of the 82 two-eye articles, the analysis utilized data from: (1) one eye only rejecting data from the adjacent eye, (2) both eyes separately, (3) both eyes taking into account the correlation between eyes, or (4) both eyes using one eye as a treated or diseased eye, the other acting as a control. In a proportion of studies, data were combined from both eyes without correction. Summary: It is suggested that: (1) investigators should consider whether it is advantageous to collect data from both eyes, (2) if one eye is studied and both are eligible, then it should be chosen at random, and (3) two-eye data can be analysed incorporating eyes as a 'within subjects' factor. © 2012 The College of Optometrists.
"Xu J.P.; He Z.J.; Ooi T.L.";0.0;Further support for the importance of the suppressive signal (pull) during the push-pull perceptual training;2012;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2012.01.003;We previously designed a push-pull perceptual training protocol that effectively reduces sensory eye dominance (SED) and enhances binocular depth detection in human adults (. Xu, He, & Ooi, 2010a). During the training, an attention cue precedes a pair of binocular competitive stimulus to induce dominance of the weak eye and suppression of the strong eye. To verify that the success of the protocol is due to the suppression of the signals evoked by the stimulus in the strong eye, rather than to the attention cueing per se, we employed two new push-pull training protocols that did not involve attention cueing. Instead, we used the specific configurations of the boundary contours of the binocular competitive stimulus to render the strong eye suppressed. The first, MBC push-pull protocol has a half-image with grating feature but no boundary contour in the strong eye. The second, BBC push-pull protocol has a half-image with both grating feature and boundary contour in the strong eye. For both protocols, the weak eye receives a half-image with strong grating feature and boundary contour. These boundary contour configurations ensure that the weak eye remains dominant while the strong eye is suppressed during training. Each observer was trained with both protocols at two parafoveal (2°) retinal locations. We found that both protocols significantly reduce SED and binocular depth threshold. This confirms the basis of the push-pull protocol is the suppression of the strong eye, rather than the attention cueing per se. We further found that the learning effect (SED reduction) is more effective in the BBC push-pull protocol where the suppressed half-image in the strong eye carries both grating feature and boundary contour information, than in the MBC push-pull protocol where the boundary contour information is absent from the strong eye's half-image. This suggests that the learning effect depends in part on the availability of the image attributes for processing (suppression) during the push-pull perceptual training. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial errors in the elderly may pose challenges and even threats to self and others during everyday activities, such as localizing sounds in a crowded room or driving in traffic. In this study, we investigated the influence of aging, spatial memory, and ocular fixation on the localization of auditory, visual, and combined auditory-visual (bimodal) targets. Head-restrained young and elderly subjects localized targets in a dark, echo-attenuated room using a manual laser pointer. Localization accuracy and precision (repeatability) were quantified for both ongoing and transient (remembered) targets at response delays up to 10 s. Because eye movements bias auditory spatial perception, localization was assessed under target fixation (eyes free, pointer guided by foveal vision) and central fixation (eyes fixed straight ahead, pointer guided by peripheral vision) conditions. Spatial localization across the frontal field in young adults demonstrated (1) horizontal overshoot and vertical undershoot for ongoing auditory targets under target fixation conditions, but near-ideal horizontal localization with central fixation; (2) accurate and precise localization of ongoing visual targets guided by foveal vision under target fixation that degraded when guided by peripheral vision during central fixation; (3) overestimation in horizontal central space (±10°) of remembered auditory, visual, and bimodal targets with increasing response delay. In comparison with young adults, elderly subjects showed (1) worse precision in most paradigms, especially when localizing with peripheral vision under central fixation; (2) greatly impaired vertical localization of auditory and bimodal targets; (3) increased horizontal overshoot in the central field for remembered visual and bimodal targets across response delays; (4) greater vulnerability to visual bias with bimodal stimuli. Results highlight age-, memory-, and modality-dependent deterioration in the processing of auditory and visual space, as well as an age-related increase in the dominance of vision when localizing bimodal sources. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012."

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the dynamic characteristics of multimodal integration are not fully understood. The objective of this study is to investigate the basic mechanisms of multimodal integration by assessing the intermodal influences of vision, audition, and somatosensory sensations (the influence of multisensory background events to the target event). We used a timed target detection task, and measured both behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to visual target events (green solid circle), auditory target events (2 kHz pure tone) and somatosensory target events (1.5 ± 0.1 mA square wave pulse) from 20 normal participants. There were significant differences in both behavior performance and ERP components when comparing the unimodal target stimuli with multimodal (bimodal and trimodal) target stimuli for all target groups. Significant correlation among reaction time and P3 latency was observed across all target conditions. The perceptual processing of auditory target events (A) was inhibited by the background events, while the perceptual processing of somatosensory target events (S) was facilitated by the background events. In contrast, the perceptual processing of visual target events (V) remained impervious to multisensory background events. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

The MDD-2 Macular Degeneration Detection Device is a novel flash photostress recovery device. In this study, we examine the repeatability of the MDD-2 in a normal population and its suitability for incorporation into routine clinical practice. Methods: One hundred (60 female) subjects (mean age 35 ± 8 years; range 18 to 66 years) were recruited to partake in this study. The photostress recovery time was measured using the MDD-2 on three occasions in the dominant eye and one final occasion in the non-dominant eye to assess measurement repeatability. All subjects were in good ocular health. Visual acuity and iris colour were recorded for each participant. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant learning effect on intra-measurement repeatability (p < 0.01). Although paired t-test analysis revealed statistically significant differences between repeated measures both within and between eyes (p < 0.05 for all) the correlation between repeat measurements is statistically significant (p < 0.05 for all), and the coefficient of repeatability reaches clinically acceptable levels once the initial photostress recovery time, which demonstrated increased variability and latency compared to all subsequent measures, is excluded. Conclusion: The MDD-2 provides highly repeatable measurements of photostress recovery time among young naïve subjects, following verbal explanation of the task and only one 'practise' measurement. The measurement is also highly repeatable between eyes, providing a potential immediate clinical biomarker of ocular health. © 2012 The Authors Clinical and Experimental Optometry © 2012 Optometrists Association Australia."

However, the associated induced interocular differences in retinal illuminance may cause distortion in spatial perception due to the Pulfrich effect. Methods: Three young subjects were used to explore the Pulfrich effect during reduced-aperture monovision using afocal contact lenses (in the non-dominant eye) which were either opaque with a central clear aperture of 1.5, 2.5 or 3.5 mm diameter, or had an annular opaque stop of inner and outer diameters 1.5 and 4.0 mm, respectively. The two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task of the subject was to state whether a 2° circular spot appeared in front or behind the plane of a central cross when moved left-to-right or right-to-left. The retinal illuminance of the dominant eye was varied using neutral density (ND) filters to establish the ND value which eliminated the Pulfrich effect for each lens. Results: The Pulfrich effect was observed with all the lenses. The ND value required to null the effect decreased as the diameter of the aperture of the lenses increased. A reasonably good agreement was found between observed ND values for the different lenses and those predicted from the relative areas of the effective pupils of the two eyes. Minor discrepancies were attributed to decentration of the contact lenses with respect to the natural pupils. Conclusions: Reduced-aperture monovision generates marked Pulfrich-type distortions in spatial perception under conditions where the visual world is changing dynamically as a result of movement. © 2012 Spanish General Council of Optometry.

For maximum optical efficiency, the goal is to be able to place every pilot's eye into the HUD Eye Motion Box (EMB) given a seat adjustment range. Initially, the Eye Reference Point (ERP) of the EMB should theoretically be located on the aircraft's original cockpit Design Eye Point (DEP), but human postures vary, and HUD systems may not be optimally placed. In reality, there is a distribution of pilot eyes around the DEP (which is dominant eye dependent); therefore, this must be accounted for in order to obtain appropriate visibility of all of the symbology based on photonic characteristics of the HUD. Pilot size and postural variation need to be taken into consideration when positioning the HUD system to ensure proper vision of all HUD symbology in addition to meeting the basic physical accommodation requirements of the cockpit.

METHODS: This is a prospective non-randomized comparative study. The lifestyle zones of 32 consecutive age-related cataract patients (64 eyes) were investigated individually to guide the surgical decision between two multifocal intraocular lens implantation patterns. The first group (MIX) received a combined implantation of a ReZoom NXG1 lens in the dominant eye and a Tecnis ZM900 lens in the other eye. The second group (MATCH) received bilateral ReZoom NXG1 lenses. One year postoperatively, the patients were assessed for binocular uncorrected visual acuity, reading visual acuity, reading speed and depth of focus under different luminance and were surveyed for visual disturbances, satisfaction and complete spectacle independence. RESULTS: According to the determination of lifestyle zones, 18 and 14 patients were included in the MIX and MATCH groups, respectively. One year postoperatively, each of the patients exhibited positive visual outcomes and lifestyle satisfaction, although there were still some differences between the two groups. Generally, patients in the MATCH group had better distance visual acuity than those in the MIX group. In contrast, patients in the MIX group had better near visual acuity, better reading acuity and better reading speed than those in the MATCH group. Between the two groups, there was no clear difference in intermediate visual acuity, and the depths of focus between the two groups were approximately equal. The results of the mean NEI-RQL-42 questionnaire score, overall satisfaction, and complete spectacle independence did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Different multifocal intraocular lenses implantation patterns can have differing advantages and disadvantages; however, the best results with respect to visual outcome and patient satisfaction can be achieved by taking individual lifestyle zones into account.

We measured oxygen saturation in retinal vessels of healthy eyes to determine the effects of age, sex, and cardiovascular parameters, as well as the reliability of the measurements and topographic differences. METHODS. The Oxymap T1 retinal oximeter is based on a fundus camera. It simultaneously captures retinal images at two different wavelengths and estimates retinal vessel oxygen saturation. Mean saturation of main retinal arterioles and venules was measured in 120 healthy individuals aged 18-80 years (median 47 years). Of the 120 participants 44 (37%) were male (49 years) and 76 (63%) female (44 years). RESULTS. Oxygen saturation was 92.2 ± 3.7% (mean ± SD) in retinal arterioles and 55.6 ± 6.3% in venules. No significant difference in oxygen saturation was found between left and right eyes. The inferotemporal quadrant had lower oxygen saturation in arterioles and venules (P < 0.0001). Arteriolar oxygen saturation was stable with age. Venular oxygen saturation in males decreased by 1.9 ± 0.6% (mean ± SEM) per 10 years of age (P=0.003) and by 0.7 ± 0.4% in females (P =0.068). Arteriovenous (AV) difference increased by 1.5 ± 0.5% per 10 years in males (P=0.004) and 1.0 ± 0.4% (P=0.007) in females. For every 10 mm Hg increase in ocular perfusion pressure, oxygen saturation in arterioles increased by 0.9 ± 0.4% (P = 0.024) and in venules by 1.2 ± 0.7% (P = 0.075). CONCLUSIONS. Retinal arteriolar oxygen saturation is stable in healthy individuals, while there is a significant decrease in venular oxygen saturation with age in males and a similar trend in females. AV difference increases significantly with age for both sexes.

Can predictive reliance be assured regardless of OD technique or is the indication of a dominant eye method-dependent? Methods: Two alternative OD test formats were administered to a group of 72 emmetropic healthy young adult subjects: the 'hole-in-card' test for sighting dominance and the '+1.50D blur' test for sensory dominance. Both techniques were chosen as being likely familiar to the majority of ophthalmic clinicians; to promote and expedite application during the examination routine neither test required specialist training nor equipment. Results: Right eye dominance was indicated in 71% of cases by the sighting test but in only 54% of subjects using the sensory test. The laterality of OD indicated for the individual subject by each technique was in agreement on only 50% of occasions. Conclusions: Reasons are considered for the poor intra-individual agreement between OD tests, along with an item of procedural advice for the clinician. © 2011 Spanish General Council of Optometry."
"Jainta S.; Jaschinski W.";0.0;Individual differences in binocular coordination are uncovered by directly comparing monocular and binocular reading conditions;2012;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;10.1167/iovs.12-9707;PURPOSE. We evaluated systematically binocular coordination during a reading task by comparing binocular and monocular reading, and considering the potential effects of individual heterophoria and eye dominance. METHODS. A total of 13 participants (aged 19-29 years, refractive errors -0.5 to 0.125 diopters [D]) read single sentences in a haploscope while eye movements were measured with an EyeLinkII eyetracker. RESULTS. When reading monocularly, saccade amplitudes increased by 0.04 degrees and first fixation durations became longer by approximately 10 ms. Furthermore, saccade disconjugacies increased, and compensatory vergence drifts during fixation turned into a divergent drift relative to the viewing distance. The vergence angle adjusted for the actual viewing distance became less convergent during monocular reading by 0.5 degrees. Moreover, in participants who were almost orthophoric, only the first fixation duration became longer (by 20 ms) when the reading conditions changed from binocular to monocular. For exophoric participants, all parameters of binocular coordination changed, and first fixation duration decreased by 20 ms. When reading monocularly, no differences between the dominant right eye and the nondominant left eye were found. CONCLUSIONS. Because of obvious differences in binocular coordination between monocular and binocular reading, some vergence adjustments are driven actively by fusional processes. Furthermore, higher demands on these binocular fusional processes can be uncovered only by a detailed evaluation of monocular reading conditions. © 2012 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

Previous studies of the properties of filled-in surfaces at the blind spot have found similarities and dissimilarities between filled-in and real surfaces and have therefore not provided a consistent view of the characteristics of the filled-in surface. First, we investigated whether filling-in utilizes a contour integration mechanism. Gratings with collinear lines filled in the blind spot more effectively than those both with orthogonal lines and without any line, suggesting that collinear facilitation underlies the filling-in of the blind spot. Second, the dynamics of binocular rivalry was examined by comparing the dominance duration distributions of filled-in and real surfaces. The results indicated that the strength of the filled-in surface was attenuated compared to that of the real surface during rivalry. Lastly, we tested whether travelling waves of dominance in rivalry could occur at the blind spot. The travelling waves could propagate through a hole only at the blind spot, suggesting that the filled-in surface helps perceptual waves to travel across the blind spot. These results suggest that the filled-in surface shares a common mechanism via a horizontal connection but that it has weak strength to suppress the opposite eye during binocular viewing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These methods vary in their feasibility for use in children. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of use of a simple trial frame-based system to evaluate interactions in children. Methods: Low contrast acuity, contrast sensitivity and alignment sensitivity were measured in the non-dominant eye of 10 normally-sighted children, 14 anisometropic children without amblyopia and 14 anisometropic amblyopic children (aged 5-11years) using goggles and a trial frame apparatus (TFA). The dominant eye was either fully or partially occluded. The difference in visual functions in the non-dominant eye between the full and partial occlusion conditions was termed the 'interaction index'. Agreement between the TFA and goggles in terms of visual functions and interactions was assessed in anisometropic children with and without amblyopia using the Bland-Altman method and t-test. Training sessions allowed subjects to become accustomed to the systems and tasks. The duration of training, the number of breaks requested by subjects and their willingness to attend further experiments were recorded in 10 subjects from each group and were compared between groups and between systems. Results: Both Bland-Altman and t-test methods indicated acceptable agreement between the TFA and goggles in visual function and interaction measures (p > 0.05), except for contrast sensitivity measured in anisometropic children without amblyopia (p = 0.042). For all subject groups, contrast sensitivity training was significantly longer using goggles than using the TFA (p ≤ 0.001). Significantly more breaks were requested in acuity and contrast sensitivity testing, when goggles were used than when the TFA was used (p < 0.045). Anisometropic children without amblyopia showed a significantly greater willingness to attend more experiments using the TFA than using goggles (p = 0.025). Conclusion: The TFA may be a useful tool in studies of interactions in amblyopes, particularly in studies of children's vision. © 2012 The Authors.

Pointer J.S.;0.0;Ocular dominance within binocular vision;2013;Binocular Vision: Development, Depth Perception and Disorders;0;"Ocular dominance (OD) can be defined and identified in a variety of ways. It might be the eye used to sight or aim, or whose input is favoured when there is competing information presented to the two eyes, or the eye whose functional vision appears superior on a given task or under certain conditions. The concept, which has been the subject of much discussion and revision over the past four centuries, continues to excite controversy today. What is becoming evident is that even in its most direct and behaviourally significant manifestation-sighting preference-it must be regarded as a flexible laterality within binocular vision, influenced by the physical circumstances and viewing constraints prevailing at the point of testing. This chapter will review the phenomenon of OD in the light of the types of test used to identify it; question whether inter-test agreement of OD in an individual might be anticipated; briefly consider the possibility of any relationship between OD and limb or cortical laterality; and speculate whether OD is essentially the product of forced monocular viewing conditions and habitual use of one or other eye. The chapter will conclude with remarks addressing some practical implications of OD as demonstrated in healthy eyes and in cases where there is compromised binocular function. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One possible cause of this variation in performance could be the distribution of eye dominance among the subject population. In this paper we explore the effects of eye dominance on iris recognition. We also show how eye dominance can be used to guide the development of a single-eye recognition system.

"Sugiyama Y.; Nishizono H.; Takeshita S.; Yamada R.";0.0;Eye dominance, visibility, and putting performance;2012;Science and Golf IV: Proceedings of the WorId Scientific Congress of Golf;0;The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship of eye dominance with subjective visibility and performance in golf putting. Twenty-four right-handed and right-eyed and 23 right-handed and left-eyed Japanese students participated in this experiment. They were asked to putt 10 balls each in three conditions, that is, both eyes condition, left eye condition, and right eye condition. After putting in each condition, they rated their subjective visibility of the ball, the cup, both the ball and the cup, and the direction. The analysis indicated that the right-eyed subjects showed significantly better performance than the left-eyed subjects in all three conditions. On visibility, the dominant eye generally had better view than the nondominant eye.

Infants' eye movements were recorded as they viewed a series of side-by-side dynamic faces. When emotion was held constant, 6-month-old infants showed no preference for ID faces over AD faces, but a second group of infants looked significantly longer at AD faces conveying happy emotion over sad ID faces conveying sad emotion. Together, these findings suggest that infants' visual preference for ID faces is mediated, at least in part, by the presence of happy emotion. The relations between happy emotion and ID faces are discussed. © 2013 The Author(s).

Methods: A retrospective multicentric analysis of 290 consecutive eyes comprising cohorts from 3 clinical settings showed that 21 eyes lost ≥15 letters on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart 1 year after the start of ranibizumab treatment. Fundus images of these eyes were analyzed by two independent readers to investigate the causes of visual loss. The three cohorts were compared. A search was made for factors predisposing to visual loss. A second analysis was performed to compare the baseline characteristics of patients who gained (visual acuity gainers) or lost (visual acuity losers) ≥15 letters. Results: Among the 290 eyes included, the proportions from each center experiencing visual loss were not significantly different (mean, 7.24%, P = 0.2631). Mean visual loss of affected eyes was 27 letters. There was no significant difference between these eyes and others as regards age and gender of patients, laterality, type of choroidal neovascularization, number of visits, or initial visual acuity. Visual loss was secondary to the progression of atrophy in eight eyes, fibrosis in five eyes, a combination of fibrosis and atrophy in three eyes, severe subretinal hemorrhage in three eyes, and retinal pigment epithelial tear in two eyes. A significant difference between visual acuity gainers and losers was observed for 2 parameters: age of patients, 80.9 ± 5.3 years in visual acuity losers versus 77.5 ± 7.3 years in visual acuity gainers (P = 0.0473) and visual acuity at diagnosis, respectively, 56.2 ± 11.2 versus 49.0 ± 12.0 (P = 0.0288). Conclusion: Although uncommon, visual loss may occur during ranibizumab treatment and is because of the natural course of age-related macular degeneration in most cases.

Extending an earlier work (Ooi & He, 2001) that measured global SED within the central 6°, the current study measured SED locally at 17 locations within the central 8° of the binocular visual field. The eccentricities (radius) chosen for this, "" binocular perimetry"" , study were 0° (fovea), 2° and 4°. At each eccentricity, eight concentric locations (polar angle: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°) were tested. The outcome, an SED map, sets up comparison between local SED and other visual functions [monocular contrast threshold, binocular disparity threshold, reaction time to detect depth, the dynamics of binocular rivalry and motor eye dominance]. Our analysis shows that an observer's SED varies gradually across the binocular visual field both in its sign and magnitude. The strong eye channel revealed in the SED measurement does not always have a lower monocular contrast threshold, and does not need to be the motor dominant eye. There exists significant correlation between SED and binocular disparity threshold, and between SED and the response time to detect depth of a random-dot stereogram. A significant correlation is also found between SED and the eye that predominates when viewing an extended duration binocular rivalry stimulus. While it is difficult to attribute casual factors based on correlation analyses, these observations agree with the notion that an imbalance of interocular inhibition, which is largely revealed as SED, is a significant factor impeding binocular visual perception. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."

Infants were presented with pairs of different sized cylinders and preferences were analyzed by age and reaching status. Outcome variables included looking and touching time for each object, first look, and first touch. Significant three-way interactions with age and reaching status were found for both infants' looking and touching duration. Four-5- and 5-6-month-olds with less reaching experience spent more time visually and manually exploring larger objects. In contrast, 5-6-month-olds with more reaching experience spent more time looking at and touching smaller objects, despite a first look and first touch preference for the largest object. Initially, looking and reaching preferences seem to be driven by mechanisms responding to general visual salience independent of an object's potential for manual action. Once reaching skills emerge, infants begin to use visual information to selectively choose smaller, more graspable objects as exploration targets. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.
"Abe S.; Kimura E.; Kyoto K.G.";0.0;Eye- and feature-based modulation of onset rivalry caused by the preceding stimulus;2011;Journal of Vision;10.1167/11.13.6;"Pre-exposure to a stimulus can modulate initial perceptual dominance experienced in binocular rivalry with brief test stimuli (onset rivalry). This study investigated this modulating effect using both color and pattern stimuli. We confirmed separate contributions of eye- and feature-based suppressions and showed that their relative strength varied with temporal parameters. Eye-based suppression was stronger with a short test duration (10 ms) and shorter ISIs between the preceding and test stimuli. On the other hand, feature-based suppression grew with ISI and was more pronounced with a longer test duration (200 ms). We also investigated the nature of the modulating effect associated with feature-based suppression using chromatic gratings of high luminance contrast. Results revealed that different features of the preceding stimulus (i.e., color and orientation) exerted nearly independent effects on onset rivalry. However, different features shared their fate in competitive interactions for perceptual dominance; when one feature became dominant, the other also dominated. These findings suggest that competitive interactions for perceptual dominance and the modulation of these interactions are mediated at least partially by different mechanisms. Overall, the present findings are consistent with a theoretical view that initial dominance is established through competitive interactions at multiple levels of processing. © ARVO."
"Gu K.; Zhai G.; Yang X.; Zhang W.";0.0;A new no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment based on ocular dominance theory and degree of parallax;2012;Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition;0;In recent years, while stereoscopic images were becoming widely applied and the corresponding technologies were substantially developed, very few stereoscopic image quality assessment metrics were proposed, especially under the condition that there is no reference image available. This paper proposes a new no-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment algorithm based on the ocular dominance theory and degree of parallax. All of our tests using the Toyama database draw two valuable conclusions. First, the performances of stereoscopic image quality assessment methods are significantly affected by difference of image qualities between the left and right images. Second, to offset the discriminations of different degrees of parallax caused by various 3D image contents is required indeed. Experiments and comparative studies are provided to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed new stereoscopic image quality metric. © 2012 ICPR Org Committee.

We enrolled 192 eyes of 192 subjects with no ocular pathology. Cone packing density was measured at three different retinal eccentricities (0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, and 1.5 mm from the foveal center) along four meridians. Cone density decreased from 32,200 to 11,600 cells/mm2 with retinal eccentricity (0.5 mm to 1.5 mm from the fovea, P < 0.001). A trend towards a slightly negative correlation was observed between age and density (r = -0.117, P = 0.14). There was, however, a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.367, P = 0.003) between axial length and cone density. Gender, ocular dominance, and race/ethnicity were not important determinants of cone density (all, P > 0.05). In addition, to assess the spatial arrangement of the cone mosaics, the nearest-neighbor distances (NNDs) and the Voronoi domains were analyzed. The results of NND and Voronoi analysis were significantly correlated with the variation of the cone density. Average NND and Voronoi area were gradually increased (all, P ≤ 0.001) and the degree of regularity of the cone mosaics was decreased (P ≤ 0.001) with increasing retinal eccentricity. In conclusion, we demonstrated cone packing density decreases as a function of retinal eccentricity and axial length and the results of NND and Voronoi analysis is a useful index for cone mosaics arrangements. The results also serve as a reference for further studies designed to detect or monitor cone photoreceptors in patients with retinal diseases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: A crossover study of 20 presbyopic patients was conducted. Patients were randomized first into either an MF or an MV lens for 15 days for each modality, with a washout period between each lens type. Measurements included monocular and binocular high-and low-contrast logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (VA) at distance and near visions, binocular distance contrast sensitivity function, and near stereoacuity. RESULTS: At 15 days, patients lost fewer than two letters (half a line of VA) of binocular distance and near VA, with the MF and MV lens under high-and low-contrast conditions (P > 0.05 for both comparisons). No statistically significant differences were seen in binocular VA at near or distance with either lens. However, the monocular distance VA improved significantly in the nondominant eye, with the MF lens by one line over the 15-day period under high-contrast (P = 0.023) and low-contrast (P = 0.035) conditions; this effect was not seen with the MV lens. Contrast sensitivity function was within the normal limits with both lenses. The stereoacuity was significantly (P < 0.01) better with MF than with MV. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal contact lens correction provided satisfactory levels of VA comparable with MV without compromising stereoacuity in this crossover study. The near vision significantly improved in the dominant eye, and the distance vision improved in the nondominant eye from 1 to 15 days with the MF lens, suggesting that patients adapted to the multifocality overtime, whereas this was not true for MV.

A 66-year-old man with multiple sclerosis in whom downbeat nystagmus appeared along with right MLF syndrome due to a unilateral pontomedullary lesion is described. In light of these findings, a possible schema for the vestibular balance control mechanism circuit of the PMT neurons via the flocculus is presented. Damage to the PMT neurons impaired the elective inhibitory control mechanism of the anterior semicircular canal neural pathway by the flocculus. This resulted in the appearance of anterior semicircular canal-dominant vestibular imbalance and the formation of downbeat nystagmus. From the pathogenesis of this vertical vestibular nystagmus, the action of the PMT neurons in the vestibular eye movement neuronal pathway to maintain vestibular balance was conjectured to be as follows. PMT neurons transmit vestibular information from the anterior semicircular canals to the cerebellum, forming a cerebellum/brainstem feedback loop. Vestibular information from that loop is integrated in the cerebellum, inhibiting only the anterior semicircular canal neuronal pathway via the flocculus and controlling vestibular balance. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These different tendencies are estimated from the slope and correlation coefficient of the plot of perceived depth difference versus stimuli depth difference. This estimation was derived using the same experimental system setup composed of two displays and a half mirror for all three 3-D display methods. The perceived depth difference was measured for four subjects by calipers using two fingers. The slope and correlation coefficient had almost the same tendencies as follows. The real object had the smallest decrease among the three 3-D display methods when the dominant eye's visual acuity was decreased and the protruding stereoscopic display had the largest decrease. The DFD display method had an intermediate decrease between those of the real object and protruding stereoscopic display. When the dominant eye's visual acuity was high enough, the differences among the three 3-D display methods were small. When its visual acuity was decreased, the differences increased among the three 3-D display methods and became statistically significant.

The current study reports on a new measure of skilled hand preference derived from the Provins and Cunliffe (1972) handedness inventory. Undergraduates ( n=3324) indicated their lateral preference for their hands, feet, eyes and ears. A measure of hand performance and familial handedness was also obtained. Factor analysis identified ten items that loaded on skilled hand preference and these were included in the new FLANDERS questionnaire. Cluster analysis of the new questionnaire revealed three distinct groups (left-, mixed- & right-handed). The new test showed a strong association with other measures of lateral preference and hand performance. Scores on the test were also related to the sex of the respondent and the hand preference of their parents. The FLANDERS provides a measure of skilled hand preference that is easy to administer and understand and should be useful for experimenters wanting to screen for hand preference. © 2013.

We determined the impact of glaucoma severity and laterality on vision-specific functioning (VF) in an Asian population. Methods. The Singapore Malay Eye Study (SiMES) was a population-based cross-sectional study of 3280 Malays aged 40 to 80 years. VF was assessed using the VF-11 questionnaire. Associations between VF-11 score and glaucoma clinical indices (glaucoma severity in better and worse eyes, and laterality) were determined by multivariate regression modeling. Glaucoma severity was defined as mild, moderate, advanced, and severe based on the Hodapp-Anderson-Parish system. Rasch analysis was used to validate the VF-11 and determine its psychometric properties. Results. Of 926 persons analyzed, 123 had glaucoma (13.3% glaucoma prevalence in analyzed sample). The mean ± SD VF score was 3.64 ± 1.05 log of odds units (Logits). In multivariate models adjusting for sociodemographic, ocular, and systemic variables, poorer VF was associated with increasingly worse eye visual field loss (β = 0.016, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.004-0.029, P < 0.001), but not that of the better eye (P > 0.05). Compared to controls, VF was reduced in individuals with worse eye advanced and severe glaucoma (β = -0.65, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.28, P < 0.05), but not mild or moderate glaucoma (P > 0.05). Compared to controls, VF was reduced in unilateral (β = -0.29, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.04, P < 0.05), but not bilateral glaucoma (P > 0.05). These associations remained significant after adjusting for presenting and best-corrected visual acuity. Conclusions. Among Singaporean Malays, unilateral, and advanced and severe glaucoma in the worse eye significantly impacts on VF. Identifying early-stage glaucoma, preventing progression, and visual rehabilitation in advanced glaucoma are important aspects of glaucoma management. © 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.
"Kawasaki M.; Yamaguchi Y.";0.0;Effects of subjective preference of colors on attention-related occipital theta oscillations;2012;NeuroImage;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.042;Human daily behaviors are often affected by subjective preferences. Studies have shown that physical responses are affected by unconscious preferences before conscious decision making. Accordingly, attention-related neural activities could be influenced by unconscious preferences. However, few neurological data exist on the relationship between visual attention and subjective preference. To address this issue, we focused on lateralization during visual attention and investigated the effects of subjective color preferences on visual attention-related brain activities. We recorded electroencephalograph (EEG) data during a preference judgment task that required 19 participants to choose their preferred color from 2 colors simultaneously presented to the right and left hemifields. In addition, to identify oscillatory activity during visual attention, we conducted a control experiment in which the participants focused on either the right or the left color without stating their preference. The EEG results showed enhanced theta (4-6 Hz) and decreased alpha (10-12 Hz) activities in the right and left occipital electrodes when the participants focused on the color in the opposite hemifield. Occipital theta synchronizations also increased contralaterally to the hemifield to which the preferred color was presented, whereas the alpha desynchronizations showed no lateralization. The contralateral occipital theta activity lasted longer than the ipsilateral occipital theta activity. Interestingly, theta lateralization was observed even when the preferred color was presented to the unattended side in the control experiment, revealing the strength of the preference-related theta-modulation effect irrespective of visual attention. These results indicate that subjective preferences modulate visual attention-related brain activities. © 2011.

A total of 131 cases of AZOOR (205 eyes), including the variant known as acute annular outer retinopathy, have been reported in the English language literature. In this group of predominantly white individuals, average age at presentation was 36.7 years, and the male:female ratio was 1:3.2. The majority of patients complained of the acute onset of a scotoma, which was associated with photopsia. Visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 74% of tested eyes, and fundus examination was unremarkable in 76% of eyes. Blind spot enlargement, with or without other field defects, was observed in 75% of the visual fields examined, and electroretinographic abnormalities were recorded in 99% of patients tested. Typically patients retained good visual acuity, although retinal pigment epithelial disturbances commonly developed over time. It was unusual for visual field loss to continue beyond six months. Various treatments have been attempted in patients with AZOOR-including systemic corticosteroids, other systemic immunosuppressive agents, and different antimicrobials-but none have been proven effective. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigated whether this reduction in performance was dependent on eye dominance and whether it could be reduced or eliminated through training. Our performance measure was the amount of time it took operators to make correct decisions on a simplified targeting task using a see-through monocular headmounted display and a large-screen display upon which was presented an out-the-window view of a desert scene. A binocular on-screen viewing condition served as baseline. The results revealed that response time significantly decreased with training but that eye dominance did not exert a significant effect. These results are interpreted within the context of training regimes for using HMDs with sparse symbology. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.
"Chopin A.; Mamassian P.";0.0;Task usefulness affects perception of rivalrous images;2010;Psychological Science;10.1177/0956797610389190;In bistable perception, several interpretations of the same physical stimulus are perceived in alternation. If one interpretation appears to help the observer to be successful in an auxiliary task, will that interpretation be seen more often than the other? We addressed this question using rivalrous stimuli. One of the elicited percepts presented an advantage for a separate visual search task that was run in close temporal proximity to the rivalry task. We found that the percept that was useful for the search task became dominant over the alternate percept. Observers were not aware of the manipulation that made one percept more useful, which suggests that usefulness was learned implicitly. The learning influenced only the first percept of each rivalrous presentation, but the bias persisted even when the useful percept was no longer useful. The long-lasting aspect of the effect distinguishes it from other documented attentional effects on bistable perception. Therefore, using implicit learning, we demonstrated that task usefulness can durably change the appearance of a stimulus. © The Author(s) 2010.

The gene associated with Rb is retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1), a tumor suppressor gene which is located at chromosome 13q14. Although previous studies had reported polymorphisms in this gene, limited information is available on the Malaysian populations. A to G SNP at the nucleotide 153104 of RB1 gene was previously reported to be common only in Asian populations, with higher heterozygosity rates among the Southeast Asians. We conducted this study to determine the distribution of this SNP in Malaysian children with Rb and control subjects as well as its association with the laterality and staging of the disease. Study design: Allelic association study. Material and methods: Fourty-six children with confirmed cases of Rb by clinical presentation imaging or histopathology (37 Malays, 4 Chinese and 5 Indians) and equal number of healthy volunteers with ethnic-matched patients were included in this study. DNA was extracted from blood samples and used as template in PCR amplification. The amplicons were then digested with Tsp509I and visualized using 3% of agarose gel electrophoresis. Direct sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of SNP. Result: The SNP was found in 12 out of 46 patients (all Malays) and 6 out of 46 control subjects (frequency 0.13 and 0.07 respectively). Both groups conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectation. There was no significant association of this SNP with laterality (p = 0.514) or disease staging (p = 1.000). Conclusion: We postulated that this SNP may not play role in susceptibility of individuals to the disease. To draw a right conclusion, enlarging the patient population study size in future could contribute towards a better understanding of the relationship of this SNP as an ethnic-specific marker with disease association. © 2010 Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.
"Domenech B.; Mas D.; Illueca C.";0.0;Influence of ocular dominance in the variability of the eye's anterior segment measurements;2010;Optik;10.1016/j.ijleo.2009.11.010;The visual system tends to favour one eye over the other in perceptual or motor tasks. This effect, called ocular dominance, makes those small movements in one eye be smaller and more precise than in the other eye. These dynamic effects are usually small and static devices are not capable of detecting differences between both eyes. In the last years ophthalmic devices are becoming more and more precise, thus they can be sensible to such variability. The hypothesis posed here is that variability of measures acquired this way is affected by ocular dominance. With a Pentacam system we have measured several parameters of the anterior segment of the eye. Our findings show that variables measured for the dominant eye are less dispersive than for the non-dominant eye although the limited accuracy of the device can mask this effect. The trend is confirmed by a contrast experiment and by a previous work, so we accept the validity of our hypothesis. Our main conclusion is that systematic election of the right eye in analysis of reliability or reproducibility can bias the variability of results and consequently we suggest considering dominance effects. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Visual environments with three levels of temporospatial complexity and two standard time protocols of visual stimulation, with ""gap"" and ""overlap,"" were used. In subjects with left leading eyes, saccades were more often performed with shorter latent periods in the direction ipsilateral to the leading eye than in the contralateral direction (53% versus 20%); among subjects with right leading eyes, the proportions with decreases in the latent periods in the ipsi- and contralateral directions were different (25% and 22%, respectively).

New technological developments now permit us to study the dynamics of the microfluctuations with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. We aim to characterise their temporal statistics for different levels of accommodative effort, using a custom-built aberrometer. We conducted 46 s long measurements on the dominant eye of 9 young, healthy subjects. The ocular wavefront was sampled every 250 μm across the 3.9 mm measured pupil, at a frame rate of 173 Hz. This enabled us to obtain high resolution estimates of the Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results show that the shape of the estimated PSD for a 4 D effort is distinct from the shape for the two extrema of the accommodation range. The autocorrelation function of the increments of the accommodation signal is also affected by the level of effort, regardless of the refractive error of the subject. © 2010 Optical Society of America.

Broadly defined, the effect occurs when people fail to respond to an auditory target if they also have to respond to a visual target presented at the same time. Previous studies have revealed the remarkable resilience of this effect to various manipulations. In fact, a reversal of the Colavita visual dominance effect (i.e., auditory dominance) has never been reported. Here, we present a series of experiments designed to investigate whether it is possible to reverse the Colavita effect when the target stimuli consist of repetitions embedded in simultaneously presented auditory and visual streams of stimuli. In line with previous findings, the Colavita effect was still observed for an immediate repetition task, but when an n-1 repetition detection task was used, a reversal of visual dominance was demonstrated. These results suggest that masking from intervening stimuli between n-1 repetition targets was responsible for the elimination and reversal of the Colavita visual dominance effect. They further suggest that varying the presence of a mask (pattern, conceptual, or absent) in the repetition detection task gives rise to different patterns of sensory dominance (i.e., visual dominance, an elimination of the Colavita effect, or even auditory dominance). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.
Kajita M.;0.0;Clinical evaluation of internal medicine containing inositol hexanicotinate on asthenopia;2010;Pharmacometrics;0;This study focused on the investigations of the effects of GSH, an over-the-counter internal medicine containing inositol hexanicotinate, analyzed by two clinical studies (Study I and II). In the Study I, the effect of GSH was evaluated in 20 subjects with asthenopia, in a double blinded, placebo controlled crossover study in which GSH or placebo was administered orally for 2 weeks. High frequency component (HFC) measured by AA-1 and subjective symptoms on eye fatigue measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) method were investigated before and after visual display terminal (VDT) work. In dominant eye analysis, changes of HFC-1 values before and after VDT work in GSH group at final visit improved compared to baseline. Changes of HFC-1 values before and after VDT work (differences from baseline to final) in GSH group significantly decreased compared to placebo group (p<0.01). Changes of VAS scores before and after VDT work in GSH group at final visit improved significantly compared to baseline. At final visit, changes of VAS scores before and after VDT work in GSH group improved significantly compared to placebo group (p<0.05). In the study II, the effect of GSH on modified blur rate (MBR) of the choroidal vessels measured by a laser speckle flow graphy was evaluated in 7 healthy subjects by an investigator blinded, placebo controlled study. At 60 min after single administration, relative MBR (when MBR of placebo is 1) significantly increased (p<0.05). These results suggest that GSH is effective in improving asthenopia.

Setting: Private practice, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: The records of dominant eyes of consecutive patients who had LASIK were retrospectively analyzed to compare the efficacy of LASIK in eyes with predominantly anterior corneal astigmatism with the efficacy in eyes with predominantly ocular residual astigmatism (ORA). The ORA was determined by vector analysis using refractive cylinder and topographic astigmatism. Preoperatively, the ratio of ORA to preoperative refractive cylinder (R) was used to divide the patients into 2 groups; that is, eyes with predominantly anterior corneal astigmatism (ORA/R ratio <1.0) and eyes with predominantly ORA (ORA/R ratio ≥1.0). Efficacy was determined by examining the magnitude of the remaining uncorrected astigmatism and comparing the index of success (proportion of preoperative refractive astigmatism that remained uncorrected by LASIK) between the 2 groups. Results: The study evaluated 61 eyes of 61 patients. Conventional LASIK was twice as efficacious in the low-ORA group as in the high-ORA group. The index of success was 0.24 and 0.50, respectively, and the difference between groups was statistically significant (P = .036). Conclusion: The efficacy of astigmatic correction by LASIK was significantly higher in eyes in which the preoperative refractive astigmatism was located mainly on the anterior corneal surface than in eyes in which it was mainly located posterior to the anterior corneal surface. © 2010 ASCRS and ESCRS."
"Kang M.-S.; Blake R.";0.0;An integrated framework of spatiotemporal dynamics of binocular rivalry;2011;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;10.3389/fnhum.2011.00088;Fluctuations in perceptual dominance during binocular rivalry exhibit several hallmark characteristics. First, dominance switches are not periodic but, instead, stochastic: perception changes unpredictably. Second, despite being stochastic, average durations of rivalry dominance vary dependent on the strength of the rival stimuli: variations in contrast, luminance, or spatial frequency produce predictable changes in average dominance durations and, hence, in alternation rate. Third, perceptual switches originate locally and spread globally over time, sometimes as traveling waves of dominance: rivalry transitions are spatiotemporal events. This essay (1) reviews recent advances in our understanding of the bases of these three hallmark characteristics of binocular rivalry dynamics and (2) provides an integrated framework to account for those dynamics using cooperative and competitive spatial interactions among local neural circuits distributed over the visual field's retinotopic map. We close with speculations about how that framework might incorporate top-down influences on rivalry dynamics. © 2011 Kang and Blake.

In the monocular and dichoptic viewing conditions, masking occurs for overlapping blobs, followed by facilitation when they are completely separated (2-8 blob sd units under monocular conditions and 4-12 blob sd units under dichoptic conditions). For LM blobs, facilitation of 24.1 ± 0.07% is demonstrated dichoptically, less than the 57.0. ± 0.06% demonstrated monocularly. For CM blobs, more robust facilitation of 39.0. ± 0.02% is demonstrated dichoptically, slightly more than the 34.6. ± 0.1% demonstrated monocularly. Lateral facilitation is thus not purely a monocular phenomenon. More robust dichoptic facilitation for CM stimuli suggests a more binocular locus for their neural processing. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
"Yang E.; Blake R.; McDonald II J.E.";0.0;A new interocular suppression technique for measuring sensory eye dominance;2010;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;10.1167/iovs.08-3076;PURPOSE. Recently devised tests have implemented forms of interocular suppression (e.g., binocular rivalry) to assess eye dominance. In an effort to combine the strengths of these tests, the authors introduce a new technique for quantifying the magnitude of interocular suppression by using an easily administered psychophysical test. METHODS. Eighty-eight observers participated in the interocular suppression test, which involved dichoptic presentation of dynamic noise to one eye and a target stimulus to the other. Observers made a form-discrimination judgment once the target emerged from suppression. The authors reasoned that the dominant eye is less susceptible to interocular suppression and as a result, perception and thus, form discrimination would be faster when the target is presented to the dominant eye as opposed to the nondominant eye. Observers' sighting dominance, acuity, contrast sensitivity, and test-retest reliability were also assessed. RESULTS. There were significant interocular differences in mean reaction times within and across observers. Of the observers, 68% and 32% observers were categorized as right eye dominant and left eye dominant, respectively, according to the test. Moreover, 38% of observers showed strong eye dominance. Observers' discrimination accuracy (98%) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.52- 0.67) were high. Consistent with results in previous studies, statistical correlations were weak between the sighting dominance test, acuity scores, contrast sensitivity measures, and the interocular suppression test. CONCLUSIONS. This interocular suppression technique offers an efficient, reliable, quantitative method of evaluating eye dominance and may be useful in making decisions about differential refractive correction of the two eyes. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.
"'t Hart B.M.; Abresch T.G.J.; Einhäuser W.";0.0;Faces in places: Humans and machines make similar face detection errors;2011;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0025373;"The human visual system seems to be particularly efficient at detecting faces. This efficiency sometimes comes at the cost of wrongfully seeing faces in arbitrary patterns, including famous examples such as a rock configuration on Mars or a toast's roast patterns. In machine vision, face detection has made considerable progress and has become a standard feature of many digital cameras. The arguably most wide-spread algorithm for such applications (""Viola-Jones"" algorithm) achieves high detection rates at high computational efficiency. To what extent do the patterns that the algorithm mistakenly classifies as faces also fool humans? We selected three kinds of stimuli from real-life, first-person perspective movies based on the algorithm's output: correct detections (""real faces""), false positives (""illusory faces"") and correctly rejected locations (""non faces""). Observers were shown pairs of these for 20 ms and had to direct their gaze to the location of the face. We found that illusory faces were mistaken for faces more frequently than non faces. In addition, rotation of the real face yielded more errors, while rotation of the illusory face yielded fewer errors. Using colored stimuli increases overall performance, but does not change the pattern of results. When replacing the eye movement by a manual response, however, the preference for illusory faces over non faces disappeared. Taken together, our data show that humans make similar face-detection errors as the Viola-Jones algorithm, when directing their gaze to briefly presented stimuli. In particular, the relative spatial arrangement of oriented filters seems of relevance. This suggests that efficient face detection in humans is likely to be pre-attentive and based on rather simple features as those encoded in the early visual system. © 2011 't Hart et al."
"Bartels A.; Logothetis N.K.";0.0;Binocular rivalry: A time dependence of eye and stimulus contributions;2010;Journal of Vision;10.1167/10.12.3;In binocular rivalry, the visual percept alternates stochastically between two dichoptically presented stimuli. It is established that both processes related to the eye of origin and binocular, stimulus-related processes account for these fluctuations in conscious perception. Here we studied how their relative contributions vary over time. We applied brief disruptions to rivalry displays, concurrent with an optional eye swap, at varying time intervals after one stimulus became visible (dominant). We found that early in a dominance phase the dominant eye determined the percept by stabilizing its own contribution (regardless of the stimulus), with an additional yet weaker stabilizing contribution of the stimulus (regardless of the eye). Their stabilizing contributions declined in parallel with time so that late in a dominance phase the stimulus (and in some cases also the eye-based) contribution turned negative, favoring a perceptual (or ocular) switch. Our findings show that depending on the time, first processes related to the eye of origin and then those related to the stimulus can have a greater net influence on the stability of the conscious percept. Their co-varying change may be due to feedback from image-to eye-of-origin representations. © ARVO.
Primo S.A.;0.0;Implantable miniature telescope: Lessons learned;2010;Optometry;10.1016/j.optm.2009.08.014;"Background: The Implantable Miniature Telescope (IMT™) is a telescopic prosthesis that, combined with the optics of the cornea, constitutes an intraocular magnifying system. It is indicated for use in patients with stable, nonfoveal sparing, bilateral, stable, age-related macular degeneration (end-stage) with associated scotomas. The telescope prosthesis is implanted in only one of the patient's eyes. In this way, the implanted eye provides improved visual acuity, and the nonimplanted eye continues to provide peripheral vision for ambulation. Two hundred seventeen patients with end-stage AMD were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, open-label trial (IMT-002) beginning in 2003. The implanted eye was the worse eye for most patients based on a selection rule set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) protocol; however, in most cases (90%), visual acuity improvement goals were met with the device. This report will retrospectively look at 2 selected patients implanted at the Emory Eye Center in Atlanta as part of that trial to derive lessons for subject and eye selection criteria. Case Reports: Two cases were selected to represent patients' levels of functional success and satisfaction. Determination of their visual and functional outcome at 1-year postimplantation was based on best-corrected visual acuity and the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25-Item quality-of-life survey. Four years after implantation, 1 patient continued to use the telescope prosthesis eye for all visual activities; the other patient did not perceive any benefit from the device and continued to primarily use the fellow nonimplanted eye. The benefit of the telescopic prosthesis was most likely accounted for by the level of visual acuity in both eyes postimplantation and eye dominance. Conclusion: Proper eye selection chosen for implantation with the telescope prosthesis appears to be an important if not critical factor in determining patient satisfaction for visual processing and functional success. Based on the author's experience with the IMT, optometrists can aid the multidisciplinary team by preoperatively determining which eye, if implanted, offers the optimal potential functional benefit for appropriate candidates. © 2010 American Optometric Association."

"Dieter K.C.; Tadin D.";0.0;Understanding attentional modulation of binocular rivalry: A framework based on biased competition;2011;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;10.3389/fnhum.2011.00155;Starting from early scientific explorations of binocular rivalry, researchers have wondered about the degree to which an observer can exert voluntary attentional control over rivalry dynamics. The answer to this question would not only reveal the extent to which we may determine our own conscious visual experience, but also advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying binocular rivalry. Classic studies, intriguingly, reached contradictory conclusions, ranging from an absence of attentional control, as advocated by Breese, to nearly complete control of rivalry dynamics, as reported by Helmholtz. Recent investigations have revisited this question, but the results have continued to echo the conflicting findings of earlier studies, seemingly precluding a comprehensive understanding of attentional effects on rivalry. Here, we review both classic and modern studies, and propose a unifying framework derived from the biased competition theory of attention. The key assumption of this theory is that the nature of stimulus conflict determines the limits of attentional modulation. For example, a condition in which unresolved stimulus conflict transpires through many levels of visual processing should be very susceptible to atten-tional control. When applied to binocular rivalry, this framework predicts strong attentional modulations under conditions of unresolved stimulus conflict (e.g., initial selection) and conditions where conflict is resolved at higher levels of visual processing (e.g., stimulus rivalry). Additionally, the efficacy of attentional control over rivalry can be increased by utilization of demanding, behaviorally relevant tasks, and likely through perceptual training paradigms. We show that this framework can help facilitate the understanding and synthesis of a diverse set of results on attentional control over rivalry, and we propose several directions for future research on this interesting topic.

The estimated eye point location is studied in particular detail. The findings of the experiment are complemented with simulated data which show that image plane orientation is sensitive to the number of correspondence points. The simulated data also illustrates some interesting properties on the numerical stability of the calibration problem as a function of alignment noise, number of correspondence points, and correspondence point distribution. © 2011 IEEE.

While it has shown to be effective, previous studies differ as to the presence of visual side effects secondary to scopolamine's anticholinergic properties. This study sought to quantify any such effects in order to determine if they are operationally significant. Methods: Fliers in NASA's Reduced Gravity Program received a weight-based dose of scopolamine/dextroamphetamine prior to boarding the aircraft. Measurements of pupil size, visual acuity, and accommodation were taken in identical conditions using subjects ' dominant eyes prior to medication administration and again after landing. We enrolled 131 subjects ages 18 - 48. Pre- and postflight measurements of pupil size and acuity were available for 125 subjects. Results: Average pupil size increased by 1.1 mm (95% CI 0.9 - 1.2). Only 1.6% of subjects experienced a change in visual acuity of greater than 10 ft. The average near-point accommodation changed from 8.61 to 7.84 diopters, a difference of 2 0.77 (2 1.01 to 2 0.53) diopters or 1.34 cm (0.87 - 1.81). Increasing age also correlated significantly with worsening change in accommodation. Discussion: This study found statistically significant changes in pupil size and near point accommodation that do not appear to be clinically important. No significant decrement in acuity was noted. While direct effects on in-flight performance could not be assessed, the use of scopolamine/dextroamphetamine among fliers aboard research aircraft does not appear to yield visual side effects sufficient to compromise later ground operations. © by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.

Methods: A total of 105 healthy volunteers from the eye clinics and staff at Washington University were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 underwent 3 sets of 2 IOP measurements per eye, starting with the right eye (right eye twice, left eye twice, right eye twice). Group 2 underwent similar measurements starting with the left eye. After 2 weeks the order of IOP measurements were reversed between groups. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance analyzed the association of IOP measurement with the order measured (1) between first and second eyes, (2) between first and second visits, (3) between right and left eyes, and (4) with ocular squeezing. Results: Intraocular pressure measured higher in first eyes compared with fellow eyes regardless of whether right or left eyes were measured first (P=.002). Intraocular pressure measurements decreased between the first and second visits (P<.001). No difference was found in IOP measurements between right and left eyes (P=.41). Moderate and severe ocular squeezing were associated with higher IOP measurements (P<.001) and occurred more during earlier than later IOP measurements within a set (P<.001) and between sets (P<.001 to P=.03). Conclusions: Intraocular pressure measured in the first eye, whether right or left, is higher than IOP measured in the fellow eye; this may be partially because of ocular squeezing. Measurements of IOP decrease between first and second visits. Multiple IOP measurements at multiple visits are necessary to accurately diagnose and treat patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. ©2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

We therefore investigated direction discrimination and speed discrimination when moving stimuli were either fixated or pursued. Our experiments showed: (1) age influences direction discrimination at slow speeds but has little affect on speed discrimination; (2) the faster eye movements made in the pursuit conditions produced poorer direction discrimination at slower speeds, and poorer speed discrimination at all speeds; (3) regardless of eye-movement condition, observers always combined retinal and extra-retinal motion signals to make their judgements. Our results support the idea that performance in these tasks is limited by the internal noise associated with retinal and extra-retinal motion signals, both of which feed into a stage responsible for estimating head-centred motion.

Visual sensitivity varies dramatically with retinal location and target, and models of optimal visual search typically assume that the visual system takes retinal inhomogeneity into account in planning eye movements. Such models can then use the entire retina rather than just the fovea to speed search. Using a simple decision task, we evaluated human ability to compensate for retinal inhomogeneity. We firstmeasured observers' sensitivity for targets, varying contrast and eccentricity. Observers then repeatedly chose between targets differing in eccentricity and contrast, selecting the one they would prefer to attempt: e.g., a low contrast target at 2° versus a high contrast target at 10°. Observers knew they would later attempt some of their chosen targets and receive rewards for correct classifications. We evaluated performance in three ways. Equivalence: Do observers' judgments agree with their actual performance? Do they correctly trade off eccentricity and contrast and select the more discriminable target in each pair? Transitivity: Are observers' choices self-consistent? Dominance: Do observers understand that increased contrast improves performance? Decreased eccentricity? All observers exhibited patterned failures of equivalence, and seven out of eight observers failed transitivity. There were significant but small failures of dominance. All these failures together reduced their winnings by 10%-18%. © 2010 Zhang et al.

We investigate whether this dominance can be observed in a behavioral visual half-field (VHF) task as well. To make sure that the VHF-effect was due to laterality and not due to attentional bias, we made use of two tasks: tool recognition and object recognition. On the basis of the existing literature, we predicted a right visual field (RVF) advantage for tool recognition, but not for object recognition. Twenty right-handed participants made judgments about whether one of two bilaterally presented stimuli was an object/non-object or a tool/non-tool. No VHF/hemisphere advantage was found for object recognition, whereas a significant RVF/left hemisphere advantage was observed for tool recognition. These findings show that VHF-tasks can be used as a valid laterality measure of tool recognition. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this response we address the two major objections raised by Boles and Barth (2011) regarding our selection of tasks and asymmetry measures. We conclude that the Boles and Barth principle of task purity is not relevant to the stated aims of our investigation, and that our linear regression method of measuring asymmetry is valid given the high level of accuracy for the tasks we reported.

We determine the effects of such a modulation on a competitive Hebbian mechanism for the modification of the feedforward afferents from the left and right eyes. We show how alternating left and right eye dominated columns can develop, in which the blobs are aligned with the centers of the ocular dominance columns and receive a greater density of feedforward connections, thus becoming defined extrinsically.

To describe the profile and identify the predictors of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness measured with frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) in normal eyes. Methods. Two hundred eighty-two normal subjects underwent macular and optic disc scanning in both eyes with Cirrus high-definition (HD)-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association between GCIPL thickness and age, sex, ethnicity (Europeans, Africans, Hispanics, Asians, and Indians), eye laterality, refraction, intraocular pressure, axial length, central corneal thickness, mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, disc and rim areas, cup-to-disc area, vertical and horizontal cup-to-disc diameter ratios, vertical rim thickness, and OCT signal strength. Results. The mean (±SD) age was 46.2 ± 16.9 years (range, 18-84 years). The mean and minimum GCIPL thicknesses (±SD) were 82.1 ± 6.2 and 80.4 ± 6.4;xm, respectively. There were significant differences in GCIPL thickness between macular sectors (P < 0.05), except between the superotemporal and inferonasal sectors (P = 0.63). The superonasal sector had the thickest and the inferior had the thinnest GCIPL. The GCIPL of the superior hemisphere was thicker than that of the inferior, and the nasal sector GCIPL was significantly thicker than the temporal one (P < 0.001). The average GCIPL did not differ between male and female subjects (P = 0.16) after adjustment for axial length and between ethnic groups (P = 0.41) after adjustment for age, axial length, and RNFL thickness. Significant predictors of mean GCIPL thickness were average RNFL thickness (β = 0.37, P < 0.001), age (β = -0.083, P < 0.001), axial length (β = -0.87, P = 0.001), and male sex (β = -1.62, P = 0.005). Conclusions. The independent factors associated with thinner GCIPL include thinner RNFL, older age, longer ocular axial length, and being male. Although the magnitude of the effect of age, axial length, and sex are small, these factors should be taken into account when interpreting Cirrus HD-OCT-based GCIPL thickness measurements. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."
Emoto M.;0.0;Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) binocular summation and DVA performance factors;2010;IEEE/OSA Journal of Display Technology;10.1109/JDT.2010.2045635;Recent developments in video technology enable us to view wider field-of-view (FOV) images using wide flat-panel displays, as one would a television monitor. New video systems with high resolution beyond HDTV have been proposed, but it is not clear that their motion picture quality will be sufficient if traditional video system frame rates are used. In the assessment of picture quality, it is recommended to screen viewers' static visual acuity (SVA), but not their dynamic visual acuity (DVA). Furthermore, the methodology to measure the DVA appropriate for the participants in such an assessment of picture quality has not yet been clearly established. In this paper, we have studied, experimentally, the changes in DVA performance by looking at differences in DVA measurement conditions as the first step to establish the methodology. We successfully verified the improvement of DVA performance in binocular viewing compared to monocular viewing. We also looked at the differences in DVA performance as a function of viewing conditions, including eye rotation direction (nasal or temporal direction), shape of the visual target (a Landolt C or E chart), ocular dominance (dominant or non-dominant eye), and the anisotropy or the difference in target orientation of a laterally moving target. © 2006 IEEE.

Here we examine the effect of a social cue, eye-gaze direction, on facial attractiveness. Given that direct gaze signals social engagement, we predicted that faces showing direct gaze would be preferred to faces showing averted gaze. Thirty-two males completed two tasks designed to assess preferences for female faces displaying a neutral expression. Participants were more likely to select the face with direct gaze, when choosing the more attractive face from direct - and averted-gaze versions of the same face. This direct-gaze preference was stronger for high-attractive than low-attractive face sets, but was present for both. Attractiveness ratings were also higher for faces with direct than averted gaze. Interestingly, stimulus inversion weakened the preference for inverted faces, which suggests the preference does not simply reflect a bilateral symmetry bias. © 2009.

Design: Combined qualitative and quantitative methods using in-depth interviews and a survey. Setting: McMaster University, including the new site of the Centre for Family Medicine in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont, and a long-established site in Hamilton, Ont. Participants: Eleven first-year and second-year family medicine residents from the Kitchener-Waterloo site participated in in-depth interviews. Forty-four first-year and second-year family medicine residents completed the survey, 22 in Kitchener-Waterloo and 22 in Hamilton. Methods: Kitchener-Waterloo residents participated in in-depth interviews during their residency programs in 2008 to 2009 using a semistructured format to explore their choice of site and the effect of an interprofessional environment on their education. Common themes were established using qualitative analysis techniques; based on these themes, a survey was developed and distributed to residents from both sites to further explore factors influencing site selection, satisfaction, and effects of interprofessional education. Main findings: Residents identified several reasons for selecting a new community-based, interprofessional family medicine residency program. Reasons included preference for the location and opportunities to learn in an interprofessional teaching environment. A less hierarchical structure and greater opportunities for one-on-one teaching also influenced their choices. Perception of poor communication from the well established site was identified as a challenge. Residents at both sites indicated similarly high levels of program satisfaction. Conclusion: Residents selected the new community-based family medicine site for reasons of geographic location and the potential for clinical learning experiences and interprofessional education. High program satisfaction was achieved at both the new and well established sites. Family medicine residency programs developing community-based networks might consider and encourage the positive influence of interprofessional care and education. Good communication between distributed sites remains a challenge."

This mode of processing has been identified with the so-called dorsal visual stream. It is generally accepted that object recognition, mediated by the ventral stream, must be important for deciding what action to execute depending on the specific object to be grasped and the particular purpose. In contrast, the kinematic parameters of the actual movement itself are supposed to be unaffected by recognition processes. This view was recently challenged by the demonstration of a significant impact of object familiarity on grasping kinematics under binocular visual control (McIntosh & Lashley, 2008). This effect was observed for very well known everyday objects. However, it remained unclear whether the effect was really due to long-term, everyday familiarity of the target objects or whether it was simply mediated by short-term learning during the experiment. Therefore, we examined whether the same effect could also be found with objects that were geometrically identical to the ones used by McIntosh and Lashley (2008) and could be distinguished by a pictorial cue but were not associated with long-term, everyday experience. We only found an effect of familiarity under monocular but not under binocular control. Our observation suggests that indeed familiarity exerts an effect on movements under binocular control only if explicit knowledge about the objects is very stable and salient, e.g. after long-term experience. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Wilson, R. Blake, & S. Lee, 2001). In Experiment 1, we characterized traveling wave dynamics using a recently developed technique called periodic perturbation (M.-S. Kang, D. Heeger, & R. Blake, 2009). Results reveal that the propagation speed of waves for a collinear stimulus increased regardless of whether that stimulus was suppressed (replicating earlier work) or dominant; this latter finding is contrary to the model's prediction. In Experiment 2, we measured perceptual dominance durations within a localized region in the center of two rival stimuli that varied in degree of collinearity. Results reveal that increased collinearity did not change average dominance durations regardless of the rivalry phase of the stimulus, again contrary to the model's prediction. Incorporating pattern-dependent modulation of adaptation rate into the model accounted for results from both experiments. Using model simulations, we show how interactions between collinear facilitation and pattern-dependent adaptation may influence the dynamics of binocular rivalry. We also discuss alternative interpretations of our findings, including the possible role of surround suppression. © ARVO."

The question of whether an activity-dependent process can refine a mapping created by an activity-independent process is addressed statistically. A new method of evaluating the quality of topographic projections is presented which allows independent consideration of the development of the centres and spatial variances of receptive fields for a projection. Synapse formation and elimination embed in the network topology changes in the weight distributions of synapses due to the activity-dependent learning rule used (spike-timing-dependent plasticity). In this model, the spatial variance of receptive fields can be reduced by an activity-dependent mechanism with or without spatially correlated inputs, but the accuracy of receptive field centres will not necessarily improve when synapses are formed based on distributions with on-average perfect topography. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine whether gait alterations due to monocular spherical lens blur were a safety strategy or driven by lens magnification. Methods. Adaptive gait and visual function were measured in 10 older adults (mean age, 74.9 ± 4.8 years) with the participants' optimal refractive correction and when monocularly blurred with ±1.00 DS and ±2.00 DS lens over the dominant eye. Adaptive gait measurements for the lead and trail foot included foot position before the raised surface, toe clearance of the raised surface edge, and foot position on the raised surface. Vision measurements included binocular visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereoacuity. Results. Equal levels of monocular positive and negative spherical lens blur led to very different stepping strategies when negotiating a raised surface. Positive blur lenses led to an increased vertical toe clearance and reduced distance of the lead foot position on the raised surface. Negative lenses led to the opposite of these changes. Conclusions.Findings suggest that step negotiation strategies were driven by the magnification effect provided by the spherical lenses. Steps appeared closer and larger with magnification from positive lenses and further away and smaller with minification from negative lenses and gait was adjusted accordingly. These results suggest that previously reported adaptive gait changes to monocular spherical lens blur were not safety strategies as previously suggested but driven by lens magnification. The significance of these findings in terms of prescribing large refractive changes in frail older patients is discussed. Copyright © 2011 American Academy of Optometry.

To assess whether there are any advantages of binocular over monocular vision under blur conditions. METHODS. The effect of defocus, induced by positive lenses, was measured on the pattern reversal visual evoked potential (VEP) and on visual acuity (VA). Monocular (dominant eye) and binocular VEPs were recorded from 13 volunteers (average age, 28 ± 5 years; average spherical equivalent, -0.25 ± 0.73 D) for defocus up to 2.00 D using positive powered lenses. VEPs were elicited using reversing 10 arcmin checks (4 reversals/s). The stimulus subtended a circular field of 7° with 100% contrast and mean luminance 30 cd/m2. VA was measured under the same conditions using ETDRS charts. All measurements were performed at 1 m viewing distance with best spectacle sphero-cylindrical correction and natural pupils. RESULTS. With binocular stimulation, amplitudes and implicit times of the P100 component of the VEPs were greater and shorter, respectively, in all cases than for monocular stimulation. Mean binocular enhancement ratio in the P100 amplitude was 2.1 in focus, increasing linearly with defocus to be 3.1 at +2.00 D defocus. Mean peak latency was 2.9 ms shorter in focus with binocular than for monocular stimulation, with the difference increasing with defocus to 8.8 ms at +2.00 D. As for the VEP amplitude, VA was always better with binocular than with monocular vision, with the difference being greater for higher retinal blur. CONCLUSIONS. Both subjective and electrophysiological results show that binocular vision ameliorates the effect of defocus. The increased binocular facilitation observed with retinal blur may be due to the activation of a larger population of neurons at close-to-threshold detection under binocular stimulation. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc."
"Ngo M.K.; Sinnett S.; Soto-Faraco S.; Spence C.";0.0;Repetition blindness and the Colavita effect;2010;Neuroscience Letters;10.1016/j.neulet.2010.06.028;People often fail to respond to an auditory target if they have to respond to a visual target presented at the same time, a phenomenon known as the Colavita visual dominance effect. To date, the Colavita effect has only ever been demonstrated in detection tasks in which participants respond to pre-defined visual, auditory, or bimodal audiovisual target stimuli. Here, we tested the Colavita effect when the target was defined by a rule, namely the repetition of any event (a picture, a sound, or both) in simultaneously-presented streams of pictures and sounds. Given previous findings that people are better at detecting auditory repetitions than visual repetitions, we expected that the Colavita visual dominance effect might disappear (or even reverse). Contrary to this prediction, however, visual dominance (i.e., the typical Colavita effect) was observed, with participants still neglecting significantly more auditory events than visual events in response to bimodal targets. The visual dominance for bimodal repetitions was observed despite the fact that participants missed significantly more unimodal visual repetitions than unimodal auditory repetitions. These results therefore extend the Colavita visual dominance effect to a domain where auditory dominance has traditionally been observed. In addition, our results reveal that the Colavita effect occurs at a more abstract, rule-based, level of representation than tested in previous research. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: A total of 42 adults (male=21, female=21) recruited through advertisements in Seoul, South Korea participated in this study. A standardized health service advertisement was designed with three controlled visual components such as (1) medical treatment information, (2) medical practitioner, and (3) medical facilities and it was shown to subjects while their eye movements were tracked and they were asked to rate their preferences for the different advertisements and their separate components. A multiple regression analysis was performed to see the correlation of the preferences for each of the three visual components with the overall preference rating of each health service advertisement. Results: Preferences for the advertisement depended mostly on the preference for the medical treatment information, whereas advertisements for complementary and alternative medical clinics depended also on the preference for the medical practitioner. Conclusions: These results imply that the same health service advertisement will be perceived differently depending on whether it advertises Western or Oriental medical clinics. © 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

We tested the hypothesis that human handedness similarly results from a combination of inborn and experience-driven factors by analysing sidedness in children suffering from congenital muscular torticollis. These children display a permanently tilted asymmetric head posture to the left or to the right in combination with a contralateral rotation of face and chin, which could lead to an increased visual experience of the hand contralateral to the head-tilt. Relative to controls, torticollis-children had a higher probability of right- or left-handedness when having a head-tilt to the opposite side. No statistical significant relation between head position and direction of functional asymmetries was found for footedness and eye-preference, although the means show a non-significant trend in the same direction as was observed for handedness. Thus, an increased visual control of the hand during early childhood seems to modulate handedness and possibly other lateral preferences to a lesser extent. These findings not only show that human handedness is affected by early lateralised visual experience but also speak in favour of a combined gene-environment model for its development. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is also true for stereo-blind subjects. One benefit of using two eyes is that looking with two eyes provides two chances of making the critical distinction. From the literature it would appear that using two eyes might only be an advantage for low contrast stimuli and simple tasks. We here demonstrate that stereo-blind subjects can benefit from using two eyes when making judgments about clearly visible complex stimuli. The task was to judge the direction of rotation of a simulated transparent cylinder. Stereo-blind subjects performed better when looking with two eyes than when looking with their preferred eye. It did not matter for their performance whether the images in their two eyes were correlated or not. Various control experiments ascertained that they judged the direction of rotation from the images in each eye separately and then combined these judgments, rather than relying on differences between the images in the two eyes. These findings raise doubts about the validity of using monocular vision as a control for quantitative studies of the use of binocular disparity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many of these studies do not distinguish between early and late phases of rivalry. There is clear evidence that the ""onset"" stage of rivalry is characterized by stable, yet idiosyncratic biases that are not evident in the average dominance of sustained rivalry viewing. Low-level stimulus features also have robust effects in the onset phase that are not seen in sustained rivalry, suggesting these phases may be driven at least partly by different neural mechanisms. The effects of high-level cognitive and affective factors at onset are less clear but also show differences from their effects in sustained viewing. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of any rivalry experiments using brief presentation paradigms and for understanding how the brain copes with binocular discrepancies in natural viewing conditions in which our eyes constantly move around an ever-changing environment. This review will summarize current research and explore the factors influencing this ""onset"" stage."

Here we used neural measures of the multisensory spread of attention to investigate the spatial and temporal linking of synchronous versus near-synchronous auditory and visual events. Human participants attended selectively to one of two lateralized visual-stimulus streams while task-irrelevant tones were presented centrally. Electrophysiological measures of brain activity showed that tones occurring simultaneously or delayed by 100 ms were temporally linked to an attended visual stimulus, as reflected by robust cross-modal spreading-of-attention activity, but not when delayed by 300 ms. The neural data also indicated a ventriloquist-like spatial linking of the auditory to the attended visual stimuli, but only when occurring simultaneously. These neurophysiological results thus provide unique insight into the temporal and spatial principles of multisensory feature integration and the fundamental role attention plays in such integration. © 2011 the authors.

Refractive lens exchange (RLE) followed by multifocal intraocular lens (MFIOL) implantation enables high rate of spectacle independance but have some visual disturbances. Laser in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) monovision gives patient ability to have good distant vision with dominant eye and good near vision with nondominant eye. In this prospective randomized study we wanted to compare clinical outcomes in patients who underwent either of the mentioned procedures. The first group included 50 patients (N=100 eyes) who underwent RLE with MFIOL implantation and the second group included 50 patients (N=100 eyes) who underwent LASIK monovision as presbyopia treatment. Uncorrected distant, near and intermediate visual acuity, patient's subjective satisfaction and visual disturbances were measured. Follow up was 6 months. Patients in RLE group had better near uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and patients in LASIK monovision group had better distant and intermediate vision. Patients in RLE group reported visual disturbances (halo, glare). Patients satisfaction and spectacle independance was high in both groups. Refractive lens exchange with multifocal intraocular lens implantation and LASIK monovision are effective methods for presbyopia treatment. LASIK monovision with-0.50D - 1.25D of residual dioptry at nondominant eye in patients under 50 years enables good vision at all distances without affecting stereovision. Patient selection and preoperative counseling are key to success.

However, these studies do not provide information about causality, i.e., whether activity reports a consequence or a cause of the perceptual change. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to individually localize four parietal regions involved in perceptual switches during binocular rivalry in 15 subjects and subsequently disturbed their neural processing and that of a control site using 2 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during binocular rivalry. We found that TMS over one of the sites, the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS), prolonged the periods of stable percepts. Additionally, the more lateralized the blood oxygen level-dependent signal was in IPS, the more lateralized the TMS effects were. Lateralization varied considerably across subjects, with a right-hemispheric bias. Control replay experiments rule out nonspecific effects of TMS on task performance, reaction times, or eye blinks. Our results thus demonstrate a causal, destabilizing, and individually lateralized effect of normal IPS function on perceptual continuity in rivalry. This is in accord with a role of IPS in perceptual selection, relating its role in rivalrous perception to that in attention [4-6]. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

The relationship between dissatisfaction and pattern visual evoked cortical potential (P-VECP) was analyzed. METHODS: A 49-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman were implanted with diffractive multifocal IOLs bilaterally. Despite good binocular visual acuity after bilateral multifocal IOL implantation, each patient experienced persistent dissatisfaction with quality and sharpness of vision even when using spectacles and contact lenses. A multifocal IOL was exchanged for a monofocal IOL in the dominant eye of each patient. Pattern visual evoked cortical potential was measured in each patient and the average of each component was calculated. RESULTS: After IOL exchange in the dominant eye, P-VECP amplitude increased, peak latency improved, and the patients' symptoms disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Monofocal IOL exchange in the dominant eye is an effective approach for dissatisfaction after bilateral multifocal IOL implantation. Copyright © SLACK Incorporated.

We found that increasing the phase-shift of the horizontal grating disk, which strengthens the boundary contour, progressively increases its predominance. But the predominance is little affected when a constant gray ring (boundary contour) is added onto the rim of the incrementally phase-shifted horizontal grating. This suggests the influence of boundary contour supersede that of the center-surround-interaction caused by the phase-shift. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Attention, considered to be the brain mechanism responsible for the selection of sensory stimuli, could be disturbed in DMD, contributing, at least partially, to the observed global cognitive deficit. The aim of this study was to investigate attentional function in individuals with DMD. Method: Twenty-five males (mean age 12y; SD 2y 2mo) with DMD and 25 healthy males (mean age 12y; SD 2y) were tested in a visuospatial task (Posner computerized test). They were instructed to respond as quickly as possible to a lateralized visual target stimulus with the ipsilateral hand. Their attention was automatically orientated by a peripheral prime stimulus or, alternatively, voluntarily orientated by a central spatially informative cue. Results: The main result obtained was that the attentional effect (sum of the benefit and the cost of attention) did not differ between the two groups in the case of automatic attention (p=0.846) but was much larger for individuals with DMD than for comparison individuals in the case of voluntary attention (p<0.001). Interpretation: The large voluntary attentional effect exhibited by the participants with DMD seems similar to that of younger children, suggesting that the disease is associated with delayed maturation of voluntary attention mechanisms. © The Authors.

Previous reports indicate that in some subjects eye-position information from the two eyes contributes unequally to the perceived EVD. Findings from other studies indicate that the retinal information from the two eyes may not always contribute equally to perceived OVD. The goal of this study was to assess whether these two sources of information covary similarly within the same individuals. Open-loop pointing responses to an isolated target presented randomly at several horizontal locations were collected from 13 subjects during different magnitudes of asymmetric vergence to estimate the contribution of the position information from each eye to perceived EVD. For the same subjects, the direction at which a horizontally or vertically disparate target with different interocular contrast or luminance ratios appeared aligned with a non-disparate target estimated the relative contribution of each eye's retinal information. The results show that the eye-position and retinal information vary similarly in most subjects, which is consistent with a modified version of Hering's law of visual direction. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The difference between the monocular/binocular RT differentials for both sizes significantly increased in the periphery (P< 0.05). The smaller target required significantly longer monocular RT at 25° (P< 0.01) and generated greater neural summation than the larger target (P< 0.01). This suggests that when monocular function has reached its limit in visual processing in the periphery, BS increases, facilitates visual processing, and shortens binocular RT. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We also investigated which parameters would be best for preparing the most suitable model for predicting GT. Methods: A total of 102 normal eyes in 102 subjects were enrolled. IC measurements were carried out at the central, superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal regions of the cornea (ICC, ICS, ICI, ICT, and ICN, respectively), followed by GT calculations. Differences between GT and IC were analyzed using the Bland-Altman method. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed using GT as the objective variable, and age, laterality of eye, spherical equivalent refractive error, corneal radius, axial length, central corneal thickness, GT, ICC, ICS, ICI, ICT, and ICN as the explanatory variables. Results: IC was higher than GT at all of the corneal regions, but the region with the least bias was ICC, followed by ICT. In the multiple regression analysis, the following prediction formula was calculated: GT = (0.445 × ICC) + (0.198 × ICN) + 3.022. When ICC was excluded from the explanatory variables, ICT had the highest partial correlation coefficient with GT. Conclusion: ICC was closest to GT, but GT could be explained better by adding ICN to the prediction model. Moreover, in instances where ICC cannot be calculated or where reliability is clearly poor due to abnormal ocular rigidity, ICT was the closest to GT measured in the central corneal region. © 2011 Baharivand et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

These groups were compared to a group of typically developing persons. Hand, foot, eye and ear laterality was assessed using item tasks, conducted twice, and Bishop's card-reaching test. Ordering of the mean IQ score for each of the three groups was as follows: trisomy 21 < del7q11.23 < del22q11.2. We observed the same ordering as for IQ, particularly in mixed handedness, degree of laterality, hand and foot consistency. The existence of a cognitive threshold, below which lateral preference is atypical, advocates for a causal link between cognition and laterality in those with low IQ although unknown other factors underlying both could determine this association. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
"Shimaoka D.; Kaneko K.";0.0;Dynamical systems modeling of Continuous Flash Suppression;2011;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2011.01.009;Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS) is a technique in which a stationary image in one eye can be reliably suppressed by rapid presentation of different flashing images in the other. In this paper we address why flashing stimuli modulate the visibility of the stimuli. We determine, in particular, which type of neural network is sufficient for the modulation of the dominance duration, assuming that elemental units are endowed with reciprocal inhibition and adaptation. We show that the model introduced by Wilson (2007) reproduces flash suppression, which is considered to be involved in CFS, but does not reproduce CFS. We then extend the model by including a stimulus feature dimension. With this extension, we found that the model accounts for the modulation of visibility observed in CFS. In addition, this model captured some defining characteristics of CFS such as dependence on flash interval and the depth of suppression. Our findings suggest that a network with inhibition and adaptation including feature dimension provides a crucial mechanism for the modulation of the dominance duration in CFS. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although many reports have failed to show a correlation, some reports have shown a relationship between sports performance and eye dominance. Methods: This report reviews some of those studies and the tests of eye dominance used in the reports. Additionally, we review the physical basis of eye dominance and the role of the binocular visual system in its determination. Lastly, a review of common facts and fallacies relating to ocular dominance is provided. Results/Conclusion: It is suggested that the visual system is designed as a binocular system, and only tests that allow for maintenance of binocular vision during the determination of ocular preference should be used if an accurate evaluation is to be made.

"Xu J.P.; He Z.J.; Ooi T.L.";0.0;Effectively reducing sensory eye dominance with a push-pull perceptual learning protocol;2010;Current Biology;10.1016/j.cub.2010.09.043;Much knowledge of sensory cortical plasticity is gleaned from perceptual learning studies that improve visual performance [1-7]. Although the improvements are likely caused by modifications of excitatory and inhibitory neural networks, most studies were not primarily designed to differentiate their relative contributions. Here we designed a novel push-pull training protocol to reduce sensory eye dominance (SED), a condition that is mainly caused by unbalanced interocular inhibition [8-10]. During the training, an attention cue presented to the weak eye precedes the binocular competitive stimulation. The cue stimulates the weak eye (push) while causing interocular inhibition of the strong eye (pull). We found that this push-pull protocol reduces SED (shifts the balance toward the weak eye) and improves stereopsis more so than the push-only protocol, which solely stimulates the weak eye without inhibiting the strong eye. The stronger learning effect with the push-pull training than the push-only training underscores the crucial involvement of a putative inhibitory mechanism in sensory plasticity. The design principle of the push-pull protocol can potentially lend itself as an effective, noninvasive treatment of amblyopia. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Stanley J.; Carter O.; Forte J.";0.0;Color and luminance influence, but can not explain, binocular rivalry onset bias;2011;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0018978;When an observer is presented with dissimilar images to the right and left eye, the images will alternate every few seconds in a phenomenon known as binocular rivalry. During sustained viewing, the timing of these switches appears to be unpredictable. Recent research has suggested that the initial 'onset' period of rivalry is not random and may be different in its neural mechanism than subsequent dominance periods. It is known that differences in luminance and contrast have a significant influence on the average dominance during sustained rivalry and that perception of luminance can vary between individuals and across the visual field. We therefore investigated whether perception of luminance contrast plays a role in onset rivalry. Observers viewed rival targets of equal brightness for brief presentations in eight locations of the near periphery and reported the color that was first dominant in each location. Results show that minimizing differences in brightness and contrast yields a stronger pattern of onset dominance bias and reveals evidence of monocular dominance. The results suggest that both contrast and monocular dominance play a role in onset dominance, though neither can fully explain the effect. © 2011 Stanley et al.
Arnold D.H.;0.0;Why is binocular rivalry uncommon? Discrepant monocular images in the real world;2011;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;10.3389/fnhum.2011.00116;When different images project to corresponding points in the two eyes they can instigate a phenomenon called binocular rivalry (BR), wherein each image seems to intermittently disappear such that only one of the two images is seen at a time. Cautious readers may have noted an important caveat in the opening sentence - this situation can instigate BR, but usually it doesn't. Unmatched monocular images are frequently encountered in daily life due to either differential occlusions of the two eyes or because of selective obstructions of just one eye, but this does not tend to induce BR. Here I will explore the reasons for this and discuss implications for BR in general. It will be argued that BR is resolved in favor of the instantaneously stronger neural signal, and that this process is driven by an adaptation that enhances the visibility of distant fixated objects over that of more proximate obstructions of an eye. Accordingly, BR would reflect the dynamics of an inherently visual operation that usually deals with real-world constraints. © 2011 Arnold.
"Eisenbarth H.; Alpers G.W.";0.0;Happy Mouth and Sad Eyes: Scanning Emotional Facial Expressions;2011;Emotion;10.1037/a0022758;There is evidence that specific regions of the face such as the eyes are particularly relevant for the decoding of emotional expressions, but it has not been examined whether scan paths of observers vary for facial expressions with different emotional content. In this study, eye-tracking was used to monitor scanning behavior of healthy participants while looking at different facial expressions. Locations of fixations and their durations were recorded, and a dominance ratio (i.e., eyes and mouth relative to the rest of the face) was calculated. Across all emotional expressions, initial fixations were most frequently directed to either the eyes or the mouth. Especially in sad facial expressions, participants more frequently issued the initial fixation to the eyes compared with all other expressions. In happy facial expressions, participants fixated the mouth region for a longer time across all trials. For fearful and neutral facial expressions, the dominance ratio indicated that both the eyes and mouth are equally important. However, in sad and angry facial expressions, the eyes received more attention than the mouth. These results confirm the relevance of the eyes and mouth in emotional decoding, but they also demonstrate that not all facial expressions with different emotional content are decoded equally. Our data suggest that people look at regions that are most characteristic for each emotion. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

However, what remains unclear is whether MDD also shows deficits in the unconscious processing of either positive or negative emotions. We conducted a psychological study in healthy and MDD subjects to investigate unconscious emotion processing and its valence-specific alterations in MDD patients. Methods: We combined a well established paradigm for unconscious visual processing, the continuous flash suppression, with positive and negative emotional valences to detect the attentional preference evoked by the invisible emotional facial expressions. Results: Healthy subjects showed an attentional bias for negative emotions in the unconscious condition while this valence bias remained absent in MDD patients. In contrast, this attentional bias diminished in the conscious condition for both healthy subjects and MDD. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate for the first time valence-specific deficits specifically in the unconscious processing of emotions in MDD; this may have major implications for subsequent neurobiological investigations as well as for clinical diagnosis and therapy. © 2011 Yang et al."
"Alais D.; Cass J.; O'Shea R.P.; Blake R.";0.0;Visual sensitivity underlying changes in visual consciousness;2010;Current Biology;10.1016/j.cub.2010.06.015;When viewing a different stimulus with each eye, we experience the remarkable phenomenon of binocular rivalry: alternations in consciousness between the stimuli [1, 2]. According to a popular theory first proposed in 1901, neurons encoding the two stimuli engage in reciprocal inhibition [3-8] so that those processing one stimulus inhibit those processing the other, yielding consciousness of one dominant stimulus at any moment and suppressing the other. Also according to the theory, neurons encoding the dominant stimulus adapt, weakening their activity and the inhibition they can exert, whereas neurons encoding the suppressed stimulus recover from adaptation until the balance of activity reverses, triggering an alternation in consciousness. Despite its popularity, this theory has one glaring inconsistency with data: during an episode of suppression, visual sensitivity to brief probe stimuli in the dominant eye should decrease over time and should increase in the suppressed eye, yet sensitivity appears to be constant [9, 10]. Using more appropriate probe stimuli (experiment 1) in conjunction with a new method (experiment 2), we found that sensitivities in dominance and suppression do show the predicted complementary changes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.
"Ling S.; Hubert-Wallander B.; Blake R.";0.0;Detecting contrast changes in invisible patterns during binocular rivalry;2010;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2010.09.009;When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, the human visual system lapses into binocular rivalry, a unique perceptual state characterized by stochastic alternations in dominance of one of the two source images over the other. Probe targets delivered to an eye during suppression phases are more difficult to detect than probes delivered during dominance phases. Nearly all probe studies have involved presenting new stimulation (e.g., a spot of light) either superimposed on or replacing the suppressed stimulus. Here, we ask whether observers can detect a reduction in the contrast of the suppressed stimulus itself. In other words, can observers detect a probe that should make an already invisible stimulus even weaker? Specifically, we compared observers' ability to detect contrast increments and contrast decrements introduced within a rival pattern during dominance and suppression. Contrast increment thresholds were elevated across all pedestal contrasts when the increment was introduced during suppression compared to during dominance, replicating previous results. Contrast decrement thresholds measured during suppression were elevated to an even greater extent, but the fact that they were obtained at all establishes that observers were able to detect probes that should make an already invisible target even more difficult to perceive. In a second experiment, we found a similar pattern of results for contrast change detection in complex images of faces as well. Based on the resulting threshold-vs.-contrast functions, we suggest that, regardless of the complexity of the image, rivalry suppression modulates the neural contrast response function through a mixture of reduced overall response gain and a shift in the contrast gain. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The perception of such final errors triggers error-correction processes that eventually result into sensori-motor compensation, opposite to the prismatic displacement (i.e., after-effects). Here we tested whether the mere observation of erroneous pointing movements, similar to those executed during prism adaptation, is sufficient to produce adaptation-like after-effects. Neurotypical participants observed, from a first-person perspective, the examiner's arm making incorrect pointing movements that systematically overshot visual targets location to the right, thus simulating a rightward optical deviation. Three classical after-effect measures (proprioceptive, visual and visual-proprioceptive shift) were recorded before and after first-person's perspective observation of pointing errors. Results showed that mere visual exposure to an arm that systematically points on the right-side of a target (i.e., without error correction) produces a leftward after-effect, which mostly affects the observer's proprioceptive estimation of her body midline. In addition, being exposed to such a constant visual error induced in the observer the illusion ""to feel"" the seen movement. These findings indicate that it is possible to elicit sensori-motor after-effects by mere observation of movement errors. © 2011 Ronchi et al."

"Denison R.N.; Piazza E.A.; Silver M.A.";0.0;Predictive context influences perceptual selection during binocular rivalry;2011;Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;10.3389/fnhum.2011.00166;Prediction may be a fundamental principle of sensory processing: it has been proposed that the brain continuously generates predictions about forthcoming sensory information. However, little is known about how prediction contributes to the selection of a conscious percept from among competing alternatives. Here, we used binocular rivalry to investigate the effects of prediction on perceptual selection. In binocular rivalry, incompatible images presented to the two eyes result in a perceptual alternation between the images, even though the visual stimuli remain constant. If predictive signals influence the competition between neural representations of rivalrous images, this influence should generate a bias in perceptual selection that depends on predictive context. To manipulate predictive context, we developed a novel binocular rivalry paradigm in which rivalrous test images were immediately preceded by a sequence of context images presented identically to the two eyes. One of the test images was consistent with the preceding image sequence (it was the expected next image in the series), and the other was inconsistent (nonpredicted). We found that human observers were more likely to perceive the consistent image at the onset of rivalry, suggesting that predictive context biased selection in favor of the predicted percept. This prediction effect was distinct from the effects of adaptation to stimuli presented before the binocular rivalry test. In addition, perceptual reports were speeded for predicted percepts relative to non-predicted percepts. These results suggest that predictive signals related to visual stimulus history exist at neural sites that can bias conscious perception during binocular rivalry. Our paradigm provides a new way to study how prior information and incoming sensory information combine to generate visual percepts. © 2011 Denison.
"Alvarez Dolado M.; Broccoli V.";0.0;GABAergic neuronal precursor grafting: Implications in brain regeneration and plasticity;2011;Neural Plasticity;10.1155/2011/384216;Numerous neurological disorders are caused by a dysfunction of the GABAergic system that impairs or either stimulates its inhibitory action over its neuronal targets. Pharmacological drugs have generally been proved very effective in restoring its normal function, but their lack of any sort of spatial or cell type specificity has created some limitations in their use. In the last decades, cell-based therapies using GABAergic neuronal grafts have emerged as a promising treatment, since they may restore the lost equilibrium by cellular replacement of the missing/altered inhibitory neurons or modulating the hyperactive excitatory system. In particular, the discovery that embryonic ganglionic eminence-derived GABAergic precursors are able to disperse and integrate in large areas of the host tissue after grafting has provided a strong rationale for exploiting their use for the treatment of diseased brains. GABAergic neuronal transplantation not only is efficacious to restore normal GABAergic activities but can also trigger or sustain high neuronal plasticity by promoting the general reorganization of local neuronal circuits adding new synaptic connections. These results cast new light on dynamics and plasticity of adult neuronal assemblies and their associated functions disclosing new therapeutic opportunities for the near future.

Stereoscopic perception requires each eye to see a slightly different perspective of the same scene, which results in two distinct projections on the display. Thus, if the user wants to select a 3D stereoscopic object in such a setup, the question arises where she would touch the 2D surface to indicate the selection. A user may apply different strategies, for instance touching the midpoint between the two projections, or touching one of them. In this paper we analyze the relation between the 3D positions of stereoscopically rendered objects and the on-surface touch points, where users touch the surface. We performed an experiment in which we determined the positions of the users' touches for objects, which were displayed with positive, negative or zero parallaxes. We found that users tend to touch between the projections for the two eyes with an offset towards the projection for the dominant eye. Our results give implications for the development of future touch-enabled interfaces, which support 3D stereoscopic visualization. Copyright 2011 ACM.
"Lai X.J.; Alexander J.; He M.; Yang Z.; Suttle C.";0.0;Visual functions and interocular interactions in anisometropic children with and without amblyopia;2011;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;10.1167/iovs.10-6755;Purpose. In uncorrected anisometropia, protracted dichoptic stimulation may result in interocular inhibition, which may be a contributing factor in amblyopia development. This study investigates the relationship between interocular interactions and anisometropic amblyopia. Methods. Three visual functions (low-contrast acuity, contrast sensitivity, and alignment sensitivity) were measured in the nondominant eye of 44 children aged 5 to 11 years: 10 with normal vision, 17 with anisometropia without amblyopia, and 17 with anisometropic amblyopia. The dominant eye was either fully or partially occluded. The difference in nondominant eye visual function between the full-and partial-occlusion conditions was termed the interaction index. The index of each visual function was compared between subject groups. A higher index indicates stronger inhibition of nondominant eye function with partial occlusion of the dominant eye. Amblyopic children had 6 months of therapy (refractive correction and occlusion), and the reduction in interocular difference in high-contrast acuity was regarded as the treatment outcome. The relationships of the interaction index with the degree of anisometropia, the severity of amblyopia, and the treatment outcomes were examined. Results. The acuity interaction index was significantly higher in anisometropic children with amblyopia than in those without (P = 0.003). It was positively correlated with the degree of anisometropia (rs = 0.35, P = 0.042) and the amblyopic treatment outcomes (rs = 0.54, P = 0.038). No such difference or association was found between the contrast sensitivity or alignment sensitivity interaction index and anisometropic amblyopia. Conclusions. Interocular interactions are associated with amblyopia, the degree of anisometropia, and amblyopia treatment outcomes, but these associations are visual function dependent. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

Although eye dominance assessment is used to assist clinical decision-making, current understanding is limited by inconsistencies across the range of available tests. A new psychophysical test of sensory eye dominance has been developed that objectively measures the relative contribution of each eye to a fused suprathreshold binocular percept. METHODS. Six standard tests and the newly developed test were used to measure motor and sensory dominance in a group of 44 binocularly normal individuals (mean age, 29.5 ± 9.10 years). The new test required observers to perform a motion coherence task under dichoptic viewing conditions, wherein a population of moving, luminance-defined signal (coherently moving) and noise (randomly moving) dots were presented separately to each eye. The observers judged the motion direction of the signal dots. Motion coherence thresholds were measured by varying the ratio of signal-to-noise dots, in a staircase procedure. RESULTS. The new dichoptic motion coherence threshold test revealed a clear bimodal distribution of sensory eye dominance strength, wherein the majority of the participants (61%) showed weak dominance, but a significant minority (39%) showed strong dominance. Subsequent analysis revealed that the strong-dominance group showed greater consistency across the range of traditional eye dominance tests used. CONCLUSIONS. This new quantitative dichoptic motion coherence threshold technique suggests that there are two separate sensory eye dominance strength distributions among observers. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

We combined two visual dominance paradigms in order to investigate crossmodal interactions between vision and touch for stimuli on versus off the body: 1) The Colavita visual dominance effect, which has recently been extended to vision and touch, and 2) The rubber hand illusion, which has often been used to probe visuotactile interactions. Specifically, we investigated whether moving a visual stimulus off the participant's body would affect visual dominance, and how this dominance would be mediated by the presence/absence of a rubber hand (given the rubber hand illusion provides a way of extending the representation of one's own body in space). Participants made speeded detection/discrimination responses to a random sequence of visual-only, tactile-only, and visuotactile targets. While participants responded near-perfectly on the unimodal target trials, their performance on the visuotactile target trials was deleteriously affected by the simultaneous presentation of a visual stimulus on (as opposed to away from) their body. In particular, when the visual stimulus was presented to their fingertip, participants failed to respond to far more of the tactile than visual stimuli on bimodal trials. The magnitude of this visual dominance effect decreased significantly when the visual stimulus was moved off the body. When a rubber hand was placed at the off-body location, a similar (albeit reduced) visual dominance effect was observed in both positions. These results therefore suggest that visuotactile interactions are strongest when visual stimuli are presented on a body (no matter whom that body, or body-part, belongs to). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find the probability and dominance duration of a percept independently adjustable. Percept probabilities and dominance durations show mutual dependencies across several perceptual switches.

To evaluate the optical characteristics of the Boston Keratoprosthesis (KPro), identify glare sources, evaluate possible glare control, and examine the benefit of implantation when the fellow eye has normal vision. METHODS. Computed and optical-bench-measured point spread function (PSF) and glare sources were compared. A translucent plastic cornea was used to determine the impact of glare caused by scatter in the cornea and its control with a dark-iris tinted contact lens. The effect of glare in implanted eyes was measured with a brightness acuity test (BAT), with and without the dark-iris contact lens. Computed and measured visual fields were compared. Stereopsis was measured in patients with an intact fellow eye. RESULTS. Computed and measured modulation transfer functions for the KPro were found to be very close to the diffraction limit. Both the model-eye measurements and patients' BAT glare responses identified that the hazy corneal graft surrounding the KPro is the main source of glare and can be controlled with a dark-iris contact lens. The lid effectively blocks the light that would be scattered in the hazy cornea of patients in whom the type II KPro was implanted. An intact fellow eye remains the dominant eye, with better acuity, and the KPro eye supports only minimal stereo ability and does not expand the binocular visual field. CONCLUSIONS. Glare can be reduced significantly with the use of a contact lens with a dark iris. Implanting the KPro in a patient whose fellow eye has normal or near normal vision does not seem to improve visual function. © Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.
Razeghinejad M.R.;0.0;Gonioscopic features in patients with acute and chronic angle-closure glaucoma;2011;Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences;0;Background: A number of ocular biometric parameters, iris hiotologic and anatomic characters have been suggested as inciting factors for converting patients with narrow angle to angle-closure glaucoma. This study was conducted to determine if there was any goniscopic difference between patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG) and chronic angle- closure glaucoma (CACG). Methods: The study is a retrospective analysis of the charts of 97 patients with asymmetric CACG and 15 patients with unilateral AACG. The age, sex, type of glaucoma, gonioscopic findings and optic nerve head cup/disc ratio were recorded for all patients. Dynamic gonioscopy and Spaeth's convention were used to grade the drainage angle. The eyes with AACG or more optic nerve damage in CACG groups were considered as involved eye, and the contralateral eyes in the AACG and CACG groups were considered as noninvolved and less-involved, respectively. Results: There was no significant difference between patients with AACG and CACG in terms of age, gender, refraction, and laterality of the involved eyes. In intragroup analysis, no significant difference was observed for distribution of iris attachment, irido-corneal angle, iris configuration, or trabecular pigmentation. In intergroup analysis, the superior iris was attached more anterior in the involved eyes of AACG compared to that in CACG (P=0.007). Moreover, the iris root attachment was also more anterior in both the superior (P=0.001) and inferior (P=0.002) angles of the noninvolved eyes of AACG vs. than those in the less-involved eyes of CACG group. Conclusion: The findings of the study indicate that there is no significant difference between the eyes with AACG or CACG in terms of goniscopic findings. However, the superior iris attachment was located more anterior in eyes with AACG compared to that in eyes with CACG.

We used a modified familiarization/novelty procedure (Chien, Palmer, & Teller, 2003) to assess basic discriminability between "" top-heavy"" and "" bottom-heavy"" geometric patterns in 2- to 4.5-month-old infants. Each infant was tested with three types of top-heavy and bottom-heavy geometric figures and received both familiarized-to-top-heavy and familiarized-to-bottom-heavy conditions. If infants of this age can discriminate the two configurations and there is no intrinsic bias toward either pattern, we expected to see significant and about equal novelty effects in both familiarization conditions. If there is a strong intrinsic bias for the top-heavy configuration, we expect to see a greater preference for the top-heavy patterns in the familiarization-to-bottom-heavy condition. Our results (N=24) showed significant and equal novelty preferences in both familiarization conditions across age and figure types, suggesting a reliable discriminability between top-heavy and bottom-heavy configurations and there is no intrinsic bias towards either configuration at this age. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Combined Effects of Ocular Dominance, Task Demand and Object Location;2010;Journal of Human Kinetics;10.2478/v10078-010-0046-x;Eighty-five right-handed subjects (39 female and 46 male, 47 being right-eye dominant and 38 being left-eye dominant) were tested on three tasks of different levels of difficulty, performed in five locations. In the current study, participants were required to pick up the tool, pick up and pantomime how to use it and pick up and actual use on the materials provided. Our goal was to evaluate how the effect of object location interacts with task difficulty on adult hand selection. We also tried to evaluate the effect of eye dominance as a biological factor on hand selection. The result showed that the frequency of preferred hand reaches was greater for pantomime and real use than the pick up condition. This effect was mediated by the position of the object in hemispace, with more right hand reaches occurring for the use and pantomime task than the pick up task. The result also revealed that there is no difference between frequency of preferred hand reaches in left- and right-eye dominant. Based on results of this study, it can be suggested that limb selection depends on task and environmental constraints, rather than a biological factor like eye dominance. © 2010, Versita.

These representations have been associated to the left and the right hemispheres respectively (Kosslyn, 1987). Recent studies have focused on the temporal dynamics of spatial relation processing, with working memory task designs. In this light, we examined the suggested lateralization effect in an ERP study incorporating a visual half field match-to-sample design, in which two sequentially presented stimuli were compared. By manipulating the length of the retention intervals between the two stimuli (500. ms, 2000. ms, and 5000. ms), spatial working memory effects were studied at three separate stages of working memory; encoding, memorization, and retrieval. The hypothesized interaction of instruction and visual field was found in the behavioural data, restricted to the 2000. ms retention interval. The EEG data indicate a strong overall right hemisphere effect, which is likely related to spatial working memory in general. Categorical and coordinate processing appears to already differentiate during the encoding stage in the P300 complex (300-500. ms after presentation of the first stimulus), where instruction interacts significantly with hemisphere in the parietal area. We found a clear right hemisphere advantage for coordinate processing and no lateralization for categorical processing. We argue that the outcome indicates qualitative rather than quantitative differences between categorical and coordinate processing. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."
"Naber M.; Frässle S.; Einhäuser W.";0.0;Perceptual rivalry: Reflexes reveal the gradual nature of visual awareness;2011;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0020910;"Rivalry is a common tool to probe visual awareness: a constant physical stimulus evokes multiple, distinct perceptual interpretations (""percepts"") that alternate over time. Percepts are typically described as mutually exclusive, suggesting that a discrete (all-or-none) process underlies changes in visual awareness. Here we follow two strategies to address whether rivalry is an all-or-none process: first, we introduce two reflexes as objective measures of rivalry, pupil dilation and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN); second, we use a continuous input device (analog joystick) to allow observers a gradual subjective report. We find that the ""reflexes"" reflect the percept rather than the physical stimulus. Both reflexes show a gradual dependence on the time relative to perceptual transitions. Similarly, observers' joystick deflections, which are highly correlated with the reflex measures, indicate gradual transitions. Physically simulating wave-like transitions between percepts suggest piece-meal rivalry (i.e., different regions of space belonging to distinct percepts) as one possible explanation for the gradual transitions. Furthermore, the reflexes show that dominance durations depend on whether or not the percept is actively reported. In addition, reflexes respond to transitions with shorter latencies than the subjective report and show an abundance of short dominance durations. This failure to report fast changes in dominance may result from limited access of introspection to rivalry dynamics. In sum, reflexes reveal that rivalry is a gradual process, rivalry's dynamics is modulated by the required action (response mode), and that rapid transitions in perceptual dominance can slip away from awareness. © 2011 Naber et al."

Methods.: This test quantifies the degree of dichoptic imbalance in coherent motion sensitivity by manipulating the contrast of stimuli seen by the two eyes. The contrast at which balanced dichoptic motion sensitivity occurs is referred to as the ""balance point"" and is an estimate of the degree of suppression. We apply the same logic to the measurement of sensory dominance by measuring the distribution of ""balance points"" within the normal population. Results.: We show that although most subjects are balanced or only weakly imbalanced, a minority is strongly imbalanced. To ascertain the site of sensory dominance, we assessed the degree to which normal sensory balance can be modulated by changing the interocular mean luminance. We found that mismatches in mean luminance between the two eyes had a pronounced effect on the balance point determination. Conclusions.: Because cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus exhibit a strong modulation to sustained changes in the mean light level, this may suggests that the inhibitory circuits underlying sensory eye dominance are located at a precortical site.

In 25 healthy subjects (4 males and 21 females) aged between 20 and 31 years, a quantitative measurement of sensory ocular dominance was performed with refractive correction and the addition of a positive lens on the dominant eye. Sensory ocular dominance was measured with a chart using binocular rivalry targets. The reversal point changed after the addition of a +1.00 D lens on the dominant eye in all subjects. However, sighting ocular dominance and stereopsis did not change after the addition of a positive lens on the dominant eye (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon test).

"Kang M.-S.; Blake R.";0.0;What causes alternations in dominance during binocular rivalry?;2010;Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics;10.3758/APP.72.1.179;"Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for perceptual alterations during binocular rivalry, including neural adaptation and neural noise. However, the importance of neural adaptation for producing perceptual alterations has been challenged in several articles (Y.-J. Kim, Grabowecky, & Suzuki, 2006; Moreno-Bote, Rinzel, & Rubin, 2007). We devised an ""online"" adaptation procedure to reexamine the role of adaptation in binocular rivalry. Periods of adaptation inserted into rivalry observation periods parametricaliy alter the dynamics of rivalry such that increased adaptation duration decreases dominance duration, which cannot be accounted for by neural noise. Analysis of the average dominance durations and their variance (coefficient of variation) provides evidence for an increasingly important role of noise in rivalry alternations as a given dominance period continues in time, consistent with recent computational models. © 2010 The Psychonomic Society, Inc."

To estimate the just-noticeable difference (JND) in ocular comfort rating by human, contact lens-wearing subjects using 1 to 100 numerical scales. Methods. Ostensibly identical, new contact lenses were worn simultaneously in both eyes by 40 subjects who made individual comfort ratings for each eye using a 100-point numerical ratings scale (NRS). Concurrently, interocular preference was indicated on a five-point Likert scale (1 to 5: strongly prefer right, slightly prefer right, no preference, slightly prefer left, strongly prefer left, respectively). Differences in NRS comfort score (ΔC) between the right and left eyes were determined for each Likert scale preference criteria. The distribution of group ΔC scores was examined relative to alternative definitions of JND as a means of estimating its value. Results. For Likert scores indicating the presence of a slight interocular preference, absolute ΔC ranged from 1 to 30 units with a mean of 7.4 ± 1.3 (95% confidence interval) across all lenses and trials. When there was no Likert scale preference expressed between the eyes, absolute ΔC did not exceed 5 units. Conclusions. For ratings of comfort using a 100-point numerical rating scale, the inter-ocular JND is unlikely to be less than 5 units. The estimate for the average value in the population was approximately 7 to 8 units. These numbers indicate the lowest level at which changes in comfort measured with such scales are likely to be clinically significant. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.
Bindemann M.;0.0;Scene and screen center bias early eye movements in scene viewing;2010;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2010.08.016;In laboratory studies of visual perception, images of natural scenes are routinely presented on a computer screen. Under these conditions, observers look at the center of scenes first, which might reflect an advantageous viewing position for extracting visual information. This study examined an alternative possibility, namely that initial eye movements are drawn towards the center of the screen. Observers searched visual scenes in a person detection task, while the scenes were aligned with the screen center or offset horizontally (Experiment 1). Two central viewing effects were observed, reflecting early visual biases to the scene and the screen center. The scene effect was modified by person content but is not specific to person detection tasks, while the screen bias cannot be explained by the low-level salience of a computer display (Experiment 2). These findings support the notion of a central viewing tendency in scene analysis, but also demonstrate a bias to the screen center that forms a potential artifact in visual perception experiments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Amblyopia is a neurologically active process: the problem is caused by either no transmission or poor transmission of the visual stimulation through the optic nerve to the brain. With time, if no treatment is performed, the weak eye becomes even weaker and the other eye becomes dominant. Amblyopia is classically treated by clarifying the visual image with glasses, and patching (totally or partially) the dominant eye in order to force the use of the amblyopic eye. Patching suffers from several problems: it is unpopular, prolonged, and it can sometimes disrupts any residual fusion between the visions of the eyes. This results often in noncompliance with the therapy. Several alternatives have been introduced, including partial occlusion and vision rebalancing in which the image to the lazy eye is enhanced and the image to the good eye is penalized. We present how a 3D technology can be used to realize a system for vision rebalancing of video clips which exploits the stereo vision of the 3D system. This technology is relatively inexpensive, easy to use also in a domestic environment, with recreational activities enjoyable by the children, and easy to extend. We have implemented a prototype software system which processes a video and sends a penalized version to the good eye and an enhanced version to the lazy eye. We use a framesever for runtime video processing and several image filters and meta-filters to obtain the final video to be viewed by the patient. We argue for the viability of the proposed method in the treatment of amblyopic children. © 2011 IEEE.

In this study, participants read texts that mentioned a goal of a character, which was later followed by information related to the original goal, a new goal, or unrelated information. Participants then performed a lexical decision task to original-goalrelated targets, which were presented to either the left visual field-right hemisphere or the right visual field-left hemisphere. When the original goal was repeated, facilitation was greater in the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere. When a new goal was introduced, the left hemisphere exhibited decreased facilitation for the original goal information. The current findings suggest that two separable mechanisms (i.e., enhancement and suppression), located in different hemispheres, may be involved when readers process goals during narrative text comprehension. © 2010 Psychology Press.

Experiment 1 compared perception from BR stimuli with monocular boundary contour (MBC) and binocular boundary contour (BBC). We found global dominance is achieved with stimulus duration as short as 30. ms for the MBC rivalry stimuli, whereas it takes more than 150. ms for the BBC rivalry stimuli. This shows that global dominance can occur rapidly in the absence of a corresponding boundary contour in one half-image. Experiment 2 measured the detection of a monocular Gabor probe located centrally on a 1.5° versus 3.0° MBC rivalry stimulus. We found reliable binocular suppression is observed earlier with the 1.5° MBC stimulus, presumably because of the probe being spatially located nearer to the boundary contour. These findings, in conjunction with those in Su et al. (2011), support the notion that the representation of the dominant surface begins at the MBC and spreads toward the center of the image. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In a previous fMRI experiment (Wallentin, Roepstorff & Burgess, Neuropsychologia, 2008) it was found that FEF activation was primarily related to the formation of an object-centered, rather than egocentric, spatial reference frame. In this behavioral experiment we wanted to demonstrate a causal relationship between eye movement control and manipulation of spatial reference frames. Sixty-two participants recalled either spatial (""Was X in front of Y?"") or non-spatial (""Was X darker than Y?"") relations in a previously shown image containing two to four objects, each with an intrinsic orientation and unique luminance. During half of all recall trials a moving visual stimulus was presented, which participants had to ignore, thus suppressing eye movement. Response times were significantly slower for spatial relations with distraction while there was no effect on non-spatial relations. There was no effect on accuracy, i.e. WM maintenance. This is consistent with the hypothesis that in spatial representations the FEFs are involved inWMcontent manipulation, such as establishing an object-centered spatial frame of reference. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Neurotransmitters can be defined as chemicals released from neurons that act on specific receptors. However, neuromodulators released from other cells, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine, and prostaglandin, can also affect neuronal signaling. Neurotransmitters and their receptor subtypes are expressed in high amounts during certain stages of development, but then persist in only a few synapses (Parnavelas & Cavanagh, 1988). The transient increase in expression of a transmitter and receptor subtype in the central nervous system (CNS) may occur during a susceptible developmental time window. (A transient increase occurs, but it may not always occur during a critical window.) Development is characterized by timing and spacing or critical periods when some kind of stimulation is essential for correct development. The transmitters and modulators affect formation of synaptic contacts, maturation of synapses, and structural refinement of connectivity by regulating electrical activity, excitability, and release of neurotrophins (Zhang & Poo, 2001). In particular, at birth a cascade of neurotransmitters and transcriptional factors is activated. For example, the norepinephrine surge at birth may be important for initiating the bonding of the infant to the mother by increasing the ability to sense odors (Sullivan et al., 1994). Imprinting at birth and visual input to form the ocular dominance columns also occur during critical periods, and are probably dependent on the switching on and off of neurotransmitters. © Cambridge University Press 2010.

Methods: Thirty-one cataract patients (62 eyes) were assigned to receive either a ReZoom NXG1 IOL in the dominant eye and a Tecnis ZM900 IOL in the fellow eye (MIOL group), or Sensar AR40e IOLs bilaterally (SIOL group). The uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) at 500 cm, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) at 500 cm, reading acuity, reading speed, near stereoacuity and questionnaire were assessed 3 months postoperatively. Results: Three months postoperatively, monocular and binocular UCVA and BSCVA at 500 cm showed no significant differences in both groups. The uncorrected reading acuity and reading speed in the MIOL group were significantly better than those in the SIOL group and were similar to that with correction in the SIOL group. The uncorrected mean near stereoacuity in the MIOL group was significantly better than that in the SIOL group (69 ± 50 seconds of arc in the MIOL group versus 180 ± 160 seconds of arc in the SIOL group). Patients in the MIOL group had a high level of satisfaction and more than 80% of them had an increased independence from spectacles for brief reading.

Several occupational hazards like awkward postures, pain, unusual spinal curvature, eye-strains and visual fatigue develop. The study tries to quantify and neutralize such eye strains. Methods: 28 male labourers ranging between 40-50 years, arbitrarily chosen from Chinsurah and Kolkata, were selected as subjects. Double blind studies were carried out whereby the subjects were divided into two groups, each of 14 subjects. Experimental group-A was involved with convergence ocular work for more than 5 years un-interrupted, whereas Control group-B was involved in other forms of work for equal days. Various physical and physiological parameters related to eye-strain development like NPC, eye adduction and abduction, IOP, accommodation reflex, eye dominance and visual acuity were assessed and statistically analyzed. Results: Results indicated that watch makers showed a significantly lower near point convergence (NPC) compared to the control group (p<0.000). Their right and left eye intra-ocular pressure(IOP) was also significantly higher (p<0.04). Quantification of visual pain was also significantly higher in the watchmakers (p<0.000) as apparent from comparable Fundus photographs. Interpretation & Conclusion: For watch makers suffering from occupational hazards, a number of ergonomical preventive measures have been recommended including alternative Work-station and personal protective equipments (PPE).
"Kang P.; Shevell S.";0.0;Multistable binocular feature-integrated percepts are frozen by intermittent presentation;2011;Journal of Vision;10.1167/11.1.1;"When two different stimuli are presented continuously to each eye, the percept alternates over time between the left-eye stimulus and right-eye stimulus. The perceptual alternation can be slowed or even stopped, however, if the same stimuli are presented intermittently (D. A. Leopold, M. Wilke, A. Maier, & N. K. Logothetis, 2002; J. Orbach, D. Ehrlich, & H. A. Heath, 1963). A basic question is the nature of the persisting neural representation, which mediates the stabilized percept. Is it a representation for the dominant eye, for the stimulus in one eye or for a feature-integrated percept incorporating features presented separately to each eye? We define a feature-integrated percept as one constructed by the visual system but which never is presented as a stimulus. This was tested using a feature-integrated percept resulting from rivalrous, equiluminant chromatic patterns (S. W. Hong & S. K. Shevell, 2009). Measurements showed that the feature-integrated percept was stabilized by intermittent viewing: when the percept at the end of the initial viewing period was featureintegrated, this same integrated percept was seen on subsequent intermittent presentations. The results showed that the stabilized percept from these intermittent rivalrous patterns was due to a persisting neural representation at or after binocular feature integration, not to a persisting dominant eye or neural representation of a retinal stimulus. © ARVO."

These observations raise the interesting question whether there is a relation between onset rivalry and rivalry in the presence of eye movements. We therefore studied binocular rivalry when stimuli jumped from one visual hemifield to the other, either through a saccade or through a passive stimulus displacement, and we compared rivalry after such displacements with onset and sustained rivalry. We presented opponent motion, orthogonal gratings and face/house stimuli through a stereoscope. For all three stimulus types we found that subjects showed a strong preference for stimuli in one eye or one hemifield (Experiment 1), and that these subject-specific biases did not persist during sustained viewing (Experiment 2). These results confirm and extend previous findings obtained with gratings. The results from the main experiment (Experiment 3) showed that after a passive stimulus jump, switching probability was low when the preferred eye was dominant before a stimulus jump, but when the non-preferred eye was dominant beforehand, switching probability was comparatively high. The results thus showed that dominance after a stimulus jump was tightly related to eye dominance at stimulus onset. In the saccade condition, however, these subject-specific biases were systematically reduced, indicating that the influence of saccades can be understood from a systematic attenuation of the subjects' onset rivalry biases. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a relation between onset rivalry and rivalry after retinal shifts and involvement of extra-retinal signals in binocular rivalry. © 2011 Kalisvaart et al.

To study the clinical characteristics of a cohort of Spanish patients diagnosed with Behçet disease and who also presented ocular inflammation. METHODS. Thirty cases of Behçet disease were studied retrospectively. The authors studied age distribution, distribution by sex, clinical course, laterality, type of uveitis, secondary glaucoma, corneal involvement, hypopyon, iris-lens synechiae, secondary cataract, cystoid macular edema (CME), and papillitis (optic neuritis). RESULTS. Fourteen of the patients were men and 16 were women (ratio 0.875:1). The mean age of the patients was 35.24 years (±10.917; 21-61 years). In 23 patients, the disease course was recurrent. In 9 patients, the disease manifested unilaterally. In 5 patients showing unilateral onset, the contralateral eye became affected. In 2 of the 30 patients, uveitis exclusively affected the anterior segment. In 8 patients, uveitis was solely posterior. There was one case of intermediate uveitis. The remaining 19 patients showed panuveitis. Three had focal chorioretinitis. One had diffuse chorioretinitis. Fifteen showed signs of diffuse vasculitis. Eight patients showed focal vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS. Women were slightly more affected than men, although the authors found no significant correlation between sex and the clinical variables examined. Apart from one unexpected case of intermediate uveitis, the observations are similar to those reported for other patient series. © Wichtig Editore, 2008."

Our previous study revealed that when an AR manual was experimentally used for a wiring task, efficiency became higher and human error decreased. However, in order to practically apply AR manuals in actual work situations, some human factor requirements should be clarified in advance. Thus, in this study, we attempt to make it clear what kinds of effects they have on performance by some conditions or restrictions. Particularly considering that a user wears a head-mounted display (HMD) and sees images presented by that superimposed on the real view, we examine the effects of those through some experiments. From the results, we found that a monocular HMD is better to be worn on non-dominant eye, that information of an AR manual should be given part by part or one by one when the real view is complicated, and so on. We suggest conditions that do not affect their performance, or rather that enhance it in actual work situations, in this study. © 2008 Academy Publisher.

The resurgence of the proto-alphabetic sensibility in contemporary electronic modes of media (PC/mobile telephony); and its significance for the status of knowledge";2009;Handbook of Research on Knowledge-Intensive Organizations;10.4018/978-1-60566-176-6.ch009;"In this chapter the author offers an argument towards the resurgence of a proto-alphabetic imagination in electronic and mobile communications. It is suggested that contemporary trends in mobile telephony which encapsulate the earlier advances in PC development are shifting electronic media - not towards a mythic culture of the aural (McLuhan) but towards an admixture of the aural and visual, aslant the controlling trope of the alphabetical. It is argued that this separation of technologies resembles the predecessors of writing technologies of a ""proto""-alphabetic nature. This infuses the literature of management with a metaphysical animism, which is redolent of the faded animism, which marked the initial confluence of the pre-alphabetical sensibilities of Eye and Voice in the pre-alphabetic emergence of mankind. This is suggested as a fresh Symbolic form towards which mankind is advancing. The confluence of ideological tensions preceding these developments is traced; including debates as to conflicts of Word and Sacred (Ricoeur); or Postmodern aversion towards contemporary ocular dominance. This debate leads towards an evaluation of the role and significance of kinds of knowledge which underpin our knowledge society and the knowledge which we take to constitute ""knowledge management"". © 2009, IGI Global."

These impairments may be related to the difficulties with face recognition characteristic of this disorder. Face perception plays a critical role in the development of social interaction and understanding of the internal emotional state of others. It depends on initial oculomotor exploration. The aim of this study was to quantify ocular behaviour in 11 adults with autism and 23 healthy subjects (15-35 years) while exploring neutral faces and faces expressing an emotion using an eye tracking method. The strategy used to explore faces was also studied. All subjects spent significantly more time on the eye region than on the rest of the face. However, subjects with autism spent less time on the eye region than healthy subjects. The latter used a strategy based on their own eye dominance when exploring faces. All healthy subjects significantly began their exploration of a face by looking at the eye in the contralateral visual field to their dominant eye. This strategy seemed to be impaired in patients with autism. To conclude, these results contrast with earlier reports regarding the lack of interest in the eye region in patients with autism, and demonstrate for the first time that perception of the face is dependent on eye dominance. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Information is combined across individual cues to form a robust representation of the external world. Here, it is shown that surface completion relying on multiple visual cues influences relative dominance during binocular rivalry. The shape of a surface determined by 1 nonrivalrous visual cue (disparity, structure-from-motion) alters the dominance patterns of a rivalrous region of the image whose shape is defined by another cue (perspective, texture). The findings indicate that contextual information promotes the perception of the member of the rivalrous pair consistent with a smooth surface representation. The results extend the current description of binocular rivalry as a hierarchical process by implying that cue combination affects image selection during bistable viewing. © 2008 American Psychological Association.
"Maruya K.; Blake R.";0.0;Spatial spread of interocular suppression is guided by stimulus configuration;2009;Perception;10.1068/p6157;When the two eyes view dissimilar monocular stimuli, the resulting interocular suppression can spread beyond the region of explicit stimulus conflict: portions of one rival target will disappear even though there is no competing stimulation at the corresponding location in the other eye's view. In a series of experiments we examined whether this spread of suppression is spatially isotropic or governed by the configuration of the stimulus a portion of which is subject to suppression. Observers reported the incidence of stimulus disappearance at different locations along or nearby the contours of a large figure, part of which was suppressed by presentation of a continuous flash-suppression stimulus to a restricted region of the other eye. For all observers, suppression spread over several degrees along the contours of the figure, but tended not to spread to locations nearby but disconnected from the figure. Suppression spread effectively over a smoothly curved contour, and it spread around a sharp corner defined by two abutting contours, albeit less effectively. Suppression tended not to spread to features within the interior of a figure (a face), even if those features formed an integral part of the figure. A gap within a spatially extended stimulus arrested the spread of suppression, unless that gap appeared to arise from occlusion. Spread of suppression was unrelated to sensory eye dominance and was found with a more conventional binocular rivalry configuration, too. These findings implicate the involvement of neural circuitry in which inhibition propagates along paths of excitation beyond spatial regions of explicit interocular conflict.

"Kang P.; Shevell S.K.";0.0;The role of luminance edges in misbinding of color to form;2008;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2008.08.014;"Perceptual misbinding of color during binocular rivalry reveals separate neural representations of color and form followed by a neural binding process. The misbinding shows that the neural representation of color from a suppressed form can be expressed within a non-retinotopic location within the dominant form. Misbinding during rivalry is known to be affected by luminance edges within the stimulus: increasing luminance-contrast at edges decreases perceptual misbinding (Hong, S.W. & Shevell, S.K. (2006). Resolution of binocular rivalry: Perceptual misbinding of color. Visual Neuroscience, 23, 561-566.). Previous work, however, did not address the question of whether misbinding depends on equiluminance (i) in the eye of the suppressed form, which contributes the misbound color to the dominant form from the opposite eye, or (ii) in the eye of the dominant form, which incorporates the misbound color. This study answered this question. Misbinding of the chromatic response from a suppressed form that contains high luminance-contrast shows that location information provided by luminance-contrast edges does not inhibit misbinding of color to a non-retinotopic location within an equiluminant form presented to the opposite eye. If filling-in of color is constrained within regions defined by luminance edges, these edges must be perceived; retinal encoding of luminance edges by itself is not sufficient to constrain the perceived location of color. © 2008."

Methods: Uncorrected distance visual acuity, unaided near visual acuity, intermediate vision and patient satisfaction were measured in 24 eyes of 24 healthy emmetropic patients who had unilateral implantation of the model SN60D3 IOL (AcrySof®ReSTOR® Natural) for surgical rehabilitation of presbyopia. Results: At the 6-month postoperative visit, all patients had 20/30 unaided binocular near vision. Binocular uncorrected distance vision was 20/20 in 83% of patients. 50% of patients were satisfied with their intermediate vision, the second 50% needs glasses for computer work. Only one patient asks for implantation of the dominant eye. A patient satisfaction questionnaire showed that 79% of patients were satisfied regarding distance, intermediate and near activities under different lighting conditions. Conclusion: The concept of implantation of an apodized diffractive multifocal IOL in the non-dominant eye for surgical rehabilitation of near vision for emmetropic presbyopic patients is very promising. The advantage of this method is that patients can learn this advanced monovision concept without risk. The implantation of the dominant eye remains as option. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

Skidayama R.;0.0;Correlation of the change in contralateral upper-eyelid height in an opening test (mechanical elevation) and after unilateral ptosis repair;2009;Japanese Journal of Plastic Surgery;0;Purpose : To estimate the predictive reliability of the opening test (mechanical elevation of the eyelid) by comparing the change in contralateral upper-eyelid height following an opening test and after blepharoptosis repair, and to determine the influence of ocular dominance on these results. Method : Twelve patients with unilateral blepharoptosis who underwent ptosis repair from December 2004 to July 2007 and had a follow-up period of at least 6 weeks were examined in the study. The margin reflex distance (MRD), the vertical distance from the corneal light reflex to the upper eyelid margin, was measured from front photographs taken before and after the operation and at the time of the opening test. The correlation between the change in contralateral MRD following the opening test and after ptosis repair was analyzed and the influence of ocular dominance was determined. The changes in contralateral MRD after the opening test (x) and after ptosis repair (y) were significantly correlated (y=0.63x-0.12, P=0.0001). There was no significant influence of ocular dominance. Conclusion: An opening test is useful for prediction of the postoperative change in the contralateral upper eyelid position after unilateral ptosis repair. This test is one of the routine preoperative evaluations of unilateral or asymmetric blepharoptosis.

The purpose of this study was to compare the nature of interocular interactions of these spatial functions in normally sighted children and adults, and to study the extent to which interocular interactions are impaired in anisometropic amblyopia. Spatial functions were measured under three viewing conditions: monocular (fellow eye occluded), dichoptic (uniform stimulus presented to the fellow eye but with a peripheral fusion lock), and binocular. Measurements were made in each eye during monocular and dichoptic viewing. In the contrast sensitivity task, Gabor stimuli were presented in one of two temporal intervals. For the alignment task, a three-element Gabor stimulus was used. The task of the subject was to indicate the direction of displacement of the middle patch with respect to the outer patches. The findings indicate that in children, binocular contrast sensitivity was better than monocular (binocular summation) but so too was dichoptic sensitivity (dichoptic summation). The magnitude of binocular/dichoptic summation was significantly greater in children than in normally sighted adults for contrast sensitivity, but not for alignment sensitivity. In anisometropic amblyopes, however, we find that for the group as a whole the amblyopic eye does not benefit when the fellow eye views a dichoptic stimulus, compared to dark occlusion of that eye. In addition, we found considerable inter-individual variation within the amblyopic group. Implications of these findings for techniques used in vision therapy are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the Edinburgh questionnaire and other tests for ""handedness"", we examined 221 healthy 9-11-year old schoolchildren for handuse preference. To test their handedness the following 6 mutually indistinguishable tests (p<0.001) were found the most reliable: writing, drawing, holding a knife, scissors, and spoon and striking a match. Congruent response or test outcomes were used for the definition of pure (100%) right-handers (n=166) and pure (100%) left-handers (n=13); the rest were rated as ambidexters (n=42). Cerebellar dominance was ascertained clinically by means of palpation and aspection; by the presence of physiological muscle hypotonia in the extremities contra lateral to the dominant upper extremity in right-handers and in left-handers. In addition to these signs of laterality, we have studied also other questions and tests (totally 34) of handedness and footedness, recorded the hair whorl form, ocular dominance and the direction of turning while standing or walking. Our findings: 1) Enhanced mirror movements in the non-dominant upper extremity while walking and greater passivity in the wrist, elbow, knee and ankle. 2) For one-foot skipping and for ball kicking the percentage of foot preference was approaching that of hand preference; half the pure right-handers used the left foot for take-off, half the pure left-handers used the right foot for take-off. 3) Physiological hypotonia was also found in the take-off foot for jump-over with what is known as crossed dominance of foot and hand (p < 0.05), thus proving that ""neocerebellar dominance"" manifests itself in accordance with hand dominance. 4) The ocular dominance depends on handedness (by eye preference at looking into a key-hole or a monoskope). 5) Trunk rotation to the left in right-handers and to the right in left-handers lacked statistical consistence. 6) The hair whorl direction was not in agreement with right-handedness or cerebellar dominance associated with it. © 2009 Act Nerv Super Rediviva."

Patients and methods: LASIK was performed in 18 eyes of 18 children having myopic anisometropic amblyopia not successfully treated with the standard amblyopia treatment for 6 months. Children were followed up at 1 week, 1, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Postoperative amblyopia therapy was continued with occlusion of the dominant eye for 6 h daily for the first 3 months and then for 4 h per day as long as possible. Results: The mean spherical equivalent refraction in the operated eye had reduced significantly from -9.08 ± 1.86D preoperatively to -0.97 ± 1.16D at 2 years postoperatively. The mean spherical equivalent in the non-operated fellow eye was -1.0 ± 1.15D preoperatively and -2.50 ± 1.15D at 2 years. The mean spherical equivalent myopic anisometropia was -7.75 ± 2.25D preoperatively and -0.50 ± 0.31D at 2 years, representing a 93.5% reduction in myopic anisometropia. The mean regression value was -2.28 ± 1.62D, however, 18 eyes (72%) were within 3.0D of the fellow eye. The mean BCVA was significantly improved from 0.72 ± 0.13 preoperatively to 0.47 ± 0.17 by 2 years after LASIK with amblyopia treatment. Conclusion: LASIK is a safe and effective alternative method for correcting myopic anisometropic amblyopia, especially in children with spectacles or contact lens intolerance, with more better visual acuity and binocular vision. © 2009.

Spence C.;0.0;Explaining the Colavita visual dominance effect;2009;Progress in Brain Research;10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17615-X;The last couple of years have seen a resurgence of interest in the Colavita visual dominance effect. In the basic experimental paradigm, a random series of auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli are presented to participants who are instructed to make one response whenever they see a visual target and another response whenever they hear an auditory target. Many studies have now shown that participants sometimes fail to respond to auditory targets when they are presented at the same time as visual targets (i.e., on the bimodal trials), despite the fact that they have no problems in responding to the auditory and visual stimuli when they are presented individually. The existence of the Colavita visual dominance effect provides an intriguing contrast with the results of the many other recent studies showing the superiority of multisensory (over unisensory) information processing in humans. Various accounts have been put forward over the years in order to try and explain the effect, including the suggestion that it reflects nothing more than an underlying bias to attend to the visual modality. Here, the empirical literature on the Colavita visual dominance effect is reviewed and some of the key factors modulating the effect highlighted. The available research has now provided evidence against all previous accounts of the Colavita effect. A novel explanation of the Colavita effect is therefore put forward here, one that is based on the latest findings highlighting the asymmetrical effect that auditory and visual stimuli exert on people's responses to stimuli presented in the other modality. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Leonards U.; Mohr C.";0.0;Schizotypal personality traits influence idiosyncratic initiation of saccadic face exploration;2009;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2009.07.013;Visual face exploration is usually biased to the left half of a presented face. Recent findings now indicate that the first saccade in face exploration has a strong idiosyncratic component with around 30% of healthy individuals showing a consistent rightward bias. We investigated in a random sample of 64 right-handed healthy participants whether this rightward bias might relate to individual differences, i.e. a psychotic-like thinking style (schizotypy). Elevated positive (magical ideation) but not negative (physical anhedonia) schizotypy scores accounted for a pronounced left-face preference for first saccades. Furthermore, when using magical ideation and physical anheonia to group individuals according to their median scale scores into four groups (either both scores elevated or low, or mixed with one score elevated, one low), participants with both scores elevated exhibited the most pronounced left-face preference and participants with both scores low the least. The same participant groups did not differ with respect to their side preference in exploring fractals nor for other exploration parameters such as first fixation duration, number of saccades or scanpath length. These findings indicate pronounced right-hemispheric dominance for face exploration in healthy individuals with elevated positive schizotypal thought. These findings contrast with expectations from studies with schizophrenic patients, and point to the relevance of individual differences in lateralized face processing. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Hecht D.; Reiner M.";0.0;Sensory dominance in combinations of audio, visual and haptic stimuli;2009;Experimental Brain Research;10.1007/s00221-008-1626-z;Participants presented with auditory, visual, or bi-sensory audio-visual stimuli in a speeded discrimination task, fail to respond to the auditory component of the bi-sensory trials significantly more often than they fail to respond to the visual component-a 'visual dominance' effect. The current study investigated further the sensory dominance phenomenon in all combinations of auditory, visual and haptic stimuli. We found a similar visual dominance effect also in bi-sensory trials of combined haptic-visual stimuli, but no bias towards either sensory modality in bi-sensory trials of haptic-auditory stimuli. When presented with tri-sensory trials of combined auditory-visual-haptic stimuli, participants made more errors of responding only to two corresponding sensory signals than errors of responding only to a single sensory modality, however, there were no biases towards either sensory modality (or sensory pairs) in the distribution of both types of errors (i.e. responding only to a single stimulus or to pairs of stimuli). These results suggest that while vision can dominate both the auditory and the haptic sensory modalities, it is limited to bi-sensory combinations in which the visual signal is combined with another single stimulus. However, in a tri-sensory combination when a visual signal is presented simultaneously with both the auditory and the haptic signals, the probability of missing two signals is much smaller than of missing only one signal and therefore the visual dominance disappears. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

The current approach borrows heavily from visual local-global research in an attempt to determine whether, as in vision, local-global auditory processing is lateralised. In vision, lateralised local-global processing likely relies on spatial frequency information. Drawing analogies between visual spatial frequency and auditory dimensions, two sets of auditory stimuli were developed. In the high-low stimulus set we manipulate frequency information, and in the fast-slow stimulus set we manipulate temporal information. The fast-slow stimuli additionally mimic visual hierarchical stimulus structure, in which the arrangement of local patterns determines the global pattern. Unlike previous auditory stimuli, the current stimulus sets contain the experimental flexibility of visual local-global hierarchical stimuli allowing independent manipulation of structural levels. Previous findings of frequency and temporal range priming were replicated. Additionally, by presenting stimuli monaurally, we found that priming of frequency ranges (but not temporal ranges) was found to vary by ear, supporting the contention that the hemispheres asymmetrically retain traces of prior frequency processing. These results contribute to the extensive literature revealing cerebral asymmetries for the processing of frequency information, and extend those results to the realm of priming.

Vertical vergence movements are known to be small requiring accurate measurement with the head stabilized, and was done with the EyeLink 2. The 2-diopter vertical prism, base down, was inserted in front of either the non-dominant eye (NDE) or dominant eye (DE) at 40 and 200 cm. The results showed that vertical vergence was stronger and excessive relative to the required value (i.e. 1.14°) when the prism was on the NDE for both distances, but more appropriate when the prism was on the DE. The results suggest that sensory disparity process and vertical vergence responses are modulated by eye dominance. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This distractor devaluation effect has previously been attributed to an association of attentional inhibition with the distractor's representation. Here, we investigated whether the associated inhibition leading to distractor devaluation is object based or feature based. Using colour-tinted face and building stimuli in a two-item simple visual search, followed by evaluation of face stimuli on a trustworthiness scale, we report that emotional evaluation was modified by prior attention whenever the search stimuli and the to-be-evaluated face shared the distractor feature, regardless of whether face identity seen in the two successive tasks matched or not. These data support the notion that inhibition can be feature-based and show that such inhibition can have emotional consequences.
"Van Damme S.; Crombez G.; Spence C.";0.0;Is visual dominance modulated by the threat value of visual and auditory stimuli?;2009;Experimental Brain Research;10.1007/s00221-008-1608-1;The simultaneous presentation of a visual and an auditory stimulus can lead to a decrease in people's ability to perceive or respond to the auditory stimulus. In this study, we investigate the effect that threat has upon this phenomenon, known as the Colavita visual dominance effect. Participants performed two blocks of trials containing 40% visual, 40% auditory, and 20% bimodal trials. The first block of trials was identical for all participants, while in the second block, either the visual stimulus (visual threat condition), auditory stimulus (auditory threat condition), or neither stimulus (control condition) was fear-conditioned using aversive electrocutaneous stimuli. We predicted that, when compared with the control condition, this visual dominance effect would increase in the visual threat condition and decrease in the auditory threat condition. This hypothesis was partially supported by the data. In particular, the results showed that the fear-conditioning of the visual stimulus significantly increased the visual dominance effect relative to the control condition. However, the fear-conditioning of the auditory stimulus did not reduce the visual dominance effect but instead increased it slightly. These findings are discussed in terms of the role that attention and arousal play in the dominance of vision over audition. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

"Matthias E.; Bublak P.; Costa A.; Müller H.J.; Schneider W.X.; Finke K.";0.0;Attentional and sensory effects of lowered levels of intrinsic alertness;2009;Neuropsychologia;10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.08.004;Low levels of intrinsic alertness are associated with lateralized performance in visual tasks, similar to neglect of the left (ipsilesional) visual hemi-field. However, it is unclear whether reduced alertness produces a specific lateralization of spatial-attentional processes in terms of the prioritization of right- over left-side stimuli, or whether it affects more basic functions of visuo-sensory coding, and/or higher function of the top-down control of selection, of stimuli on the left side. To decide between these alternatives, the present study examined the effects of lowered alertness, induced by a 50-min vigilance task, in a partial-report paradigm of briefly presented letter displays. With only one (unilateral) stimulus in display, no specific hemi-field effects were found under low-alertness conditions, indicating that reduced alertness impairs neither sensory effectiveness nor the top-town control of selection. However, with dual, bilateral stimuli, report accuracy was specifically affected for left-side targets (in subjects who showed comparable performance for both sides under normal-alertness conditions). This pattern can be interpreted in terms of a specific bias in spatial-attentional weighting, where prioritization of stimuli on the right leads to (mild) extinction of targets on the left. Moreover, participants who had a lower general level of alertness also showed a more pronounced re-distribution of weights, evidenced by a more severe imbalance in report accuracy, in a low compared to a normal state of alertness. This suggests that a low general level of intrinsic alertness engenders a specific vulnerability to neglect-like performance with a (mild) left-side extinction. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we show results of three experiments on multisensory perception of emotions using newly validated sets of dynamic visual and non-linguistic vocal clips of affect expressions. In Experiment 1, participants were required to categorise fear and disgust expressions displayed auditorily, visually, or using congruent or incongruent audio-visual stimuli. Results showed faster and more accurate categorisation in the bimodal congruent situation than in the unimodal conditions. In the incongruent situation, participant preferentially categorised the affective expression based on the visual modality, demonstrating a visual dominance in emotional processing. However, when the reliability of the visual stimuli was diminished, participants categorised incongruent bimodal stimuli preferentially via the auditory modality. These results demonstrate that visual dominance in affect perception does not occur in a rigid manner, but follows flexible situation-dependent rules. In Experiment 2, we requested the participants to pay attention to only one sensory modality at a time in order to test the putative mandatory nature of multisensory affective interactions. We observed that even if they were asked to ignore concurrent sensory information, the irrelevant information significantly affected the processing of the target. This observation was especially true when the target modality was less reliable. Altogether, these findings indicate that the perception of emotion expressions is a robust multisensory situation which follows rules that have been previously observed in other perceptual domains. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Elderly people with visual impairment have been found to be at increased risk of falling, with poor visual acuity in one eye causing greater risk than poor binocular visual acuity. The present study investigated whether monocular refractive blur, at a level typically used for monovision correction, would significantly reduce stereoacuity and consequently affect gait parameters when negotiating a raised surface. Fourteen healthy subjects (25.8 ± 5.6 years) walked up to and on to a raised surface, under four visual conditions; binocular, +2DS blur over their non-dominant eye, +2DS blur over their dominant eye and with their dominant eye occluded. Analysis focussed on foot positioning and toe clearance parameters. Monocular blur had no effect on binocular acuity, but caused a small decline in binocular contrast sensitivity and a large decline in stereoacuity (p < 0.01). Vertical toe clearance increased under monocular blur or occlusion (p < 0.01) with a significantly greater increase under blur of the dominant eye compared with blur of the non-dominant eye (p < 0.01). Increase in toe clearance was facilitated by increasing maximum toe elevation (p < 0.01). Findings indicate that monocular blur at a level typically used for monovision correction significantly reduced stereoacuity and consequently the ability to accurately perceive the height and position of a raised surface placed within the travel path. These findings may help explain why elderly individuals with poor visual acuity in one eye have been found to have an increased risk of falling. © 2008 The Authors."

Methods From April 2004 to August 2007, CT scans were performed on 64 new patients of RB with clinical findings: leukocoria (19 patients), leukocoria with proptosis (41 patients), buphthalmus (2 patients) and red eyes (2 patients). The CT scan was performed using single slice CT scan and multislice CT scan with axial and coronal section. The cases were categorized into 3 groups: grade I: tumor confined to the globe, grade II: tumor extended to orbital soft tissue or involved the optic nerve, and grade III: tumor extended beyond the orbit or intracranial space. The CT features were evaluated in each group for the presence of calcification, contrast enhancement and lateralization. Results Sixty four patients (30 females and 34 males) were evaluated. Age range: 3 months up to 9 years old; bilateral 20 patients, unilateral 44 patients. Six patients of 19 patients with clinical finding leukocoria were included in group I, and the remaining were included in group II. Twenty seven patients of 41 patients with proptotic eyes were included in group II, and the remaining were included in group III. Patients with clinical finding buphthalmus and red eyes were included in group II. All of the group I tumors (6 patients) showed calcification and enhancement. In group II (44 patients), calcification was detected in 41 patients, and there was no evidence of contrast enhancement in 6 patients. Group III (14 patients): no calcification in 2 patients, all of the tumors showed enhancement. Conclusion Our study showed calcification in 92% of RB. Calcification was not a favorable prognostic sign, because calcification was detected in almost all of the extraocular and intracranial tumors. Tumor enhancement was not correlated with extra ocular tumor extension. The finding of leukocoria without proptosis could not exclude the presence of extraocular tumor extension. Suspicious intracranial invasion should be considered in proptotic RB patient. Most retinoblastoma cases in Indonesia are diagnosed at advanced stage, so that the objective of the therapy is life saving rather than visual salvation. © 2009, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia.

METHODS: A prospective non-comparative case series included 258 eyes of 129 consecutive patients with hyperopic astigmatism and presbyopia who were treated with LASIK-induced micro-monovision. The CRS-Master software was used to generate ablation profiles for the Carl Zeiss Meditec MEL80 excimer laser. The target refraction was plano for distance eyes (dominant eye) and between -1.00 and -1.50 diopters (D) for near eyes. Patients were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: Mean attempted spherical equivalent refraction (SE) correction was +2.54±1.16 D (range: +0.25 to +5.75 D). Mean attempted cylinder was -0.52±0.49 D (range: -0.00 to -3.25 D). Median age was 56 years (range: 44 to 66 years). Median follow-up was 12.5 months (range: 3.3 months [early retreatment] to 18.2 months). The retreatment rate was 22%. Outcome measures after all treatments were as follows. Mean deviation from the intended SE correction was +0.09±0.48 D, with 79% of eyes within ±0.50 D and 95% within ±1.00 D. The cylinder correction ratio was 1.23±0.63 and the error ratio was 0.67 ±0.65. Of the distance eyes, 86% achieved uncorrected visual acuity of 20/20 and 100% achieved 20/40. Binocularly, 95% of patients achieved 20/20 and 100% achieved 20/40. Eighty-one percent of patients could read J2 and 100% could read J5. Binocularly, 95% of patients achieved 20/20 and could read J5. No eyes lost 2 or more lines of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity. A statistically significant increase was noted in contrast sensitivity at 3 and 6 cycles per degree (cpd), with no reduction at 12 and 18 cpd. The average change in refraction between 3 months and 1 year was +0.11±0.36 D with a change of >1.00 D in 2.6% of eyes. CONCLUSIONS: This hyperopic micro-monovision protocol was a well-tolerated and effective procedure for treating patients with presbyopia in moderate to high hyperopia with corrections ranging up to +5.75 D. Contrast sensitivity was improved and the distance vision of near eyes was found to contribute positively to binocular distance vision compared to distance eyes monocularly.

The degree and the axis of astigmatism were analyzed using the corneal topography. • Results: Significant correlations were found between the degree of corneal astigmatism and the age(r = 0. 092, P = 0. 003), the older they are, the bigger the degree of astigmatism is. There was no significant correlation between the gender and the degree of astigmatism (P > 0. 05),and there was no difference between the right eye and the left eye. 24. 8% eyes of these patients have less than 0. 50D of astigmatism, and exactly 41. 8% are more than 1. 00D. And the percentage of astigmatism with the rule decreased with the age(from the group of 41 - 50 years old with 66. 7% to the older than 90 with 22. 2%), but increased for astigmatism against the rule(from 20. 0% to 66. 7%). And there was no trend for oblique astigmatism. • Conclusion: In the patients with cataract, the degree of astigmatism increased with the age and more than 40% eyes of them need correct their astigmatism. And the pattern of corneal astigmatism shifts from with-the-rule to against-the-rule astigmatism.
"Suzuki M.; Gyoba J.";0.0;Visual and tactile cross-modal mere exposure effects;2008;Cognition and Emotion;10.1080/02699930701298382;The affective system enables people to perceive and judge the emotional content of stimuli from various sensory modalities. Cross-modal interactions in affective processes, however, are less well understood. Using novel three-dimensional objects, we investigated cross-modal mere exposure effects between vision and touch. Previewing objects increased the preference judged by hand, while pre-touching did not modulate the preference judged by vision. Moreover, these effects were found to be independent of recognition performance, suggesting a dissociation between affective and cognitive processing. Our demonstration of a cross-modal mere exposure effect suggests that the affective system integrates inputs from visual and tactile modalities asymmetrically.
Pointer J.S.;0.0;Influence of selected variables on monocular, interocular, and binocular visual acuity;2008;Optometry and Vision Science;10.1097/OPX.0b013e318162265d;PURPOSE. The accurate determination of a patient's monocular and binocular visual acuity (VA) is a key feature of any ophthalmic examination. The work reported here was undertaken to inform the acuity assessment procedure by establishing the influence of test sequence, patient gender, and sensori-motor laterality preference on monocular, interocular, and binocular VA values. METHODS. The test protocol required the determination of independent monocular acuities (testing right and left eyes in a randomized sequence), followed by the binocular value, in each of 100 prepresbyopic subjects conforming to specific selection criteria. A set of Landolt-ring logMAR charts for use at 20 ft (6 m) was produced for this task. In addition, the sighting eye and preferred hand of each subject were established using recognized techniques. RESULTS. The order of monocular vision testing was found to have no statistically significant influence on the VA level recorded. The group mean acuity of the left eye exceeded that of the right by 0.005 logMAR units, a difference of no statistical significance. Compared with female subjects, males revealed a consistently, statistically significant higher group mean acuity of about 0.02 logMAR units (≥1 logMAR chart symbol). However, the clinical significance of this outcome and the relatively superior left acuity might both be regarded as doubtful. Binocular visual resolution was 13% greater than the mean monocular value. Associations between combinations of preferred eye, writing hand, and better-sighted eye were at levels no greater than chance would predict. CONCLUSION. Informed by these results obtained upon visually-normal subjects, the importance of technique and the need to test a patient's VA to threshold is stressed, not only in the context of appropriate clinical case handling but also with regard to accurate record keeping. © 2008 American Academy of Optometry.
Niida T.;0.0;The functional role of ocular dominance;2008;Neuro-Ophthalmology Japan;0;Ocular dominance can be roughly classified into sighting, sensory, and motor dominance. The functional or unique role of ocular dominance, however, has yet to be fully elucidated, as a great variability has been reported for both between and within the results for the various kinds of tests. In order to achieve a successful implementation of monovision, which is a method of optical correction for presbyopia, evaluation of the magnitude of the ocular dominance as well as the determination of the dominant eye is crucial. If there is a strong imbalance for the ocular dominance, blur suppression and the smooth fixation switch between the eyes must be interfered, resulting in the disturbance of binocular visual function. It has been suggested that sighting dominance is related to the position of the headcentric visual direction. Sensory dominance can be determined by assessing the exclusive visibility of a stimulus for one eye during binocular rivalry. A similar mechanism has been suggested to occur between rivalry and strabismic suppression. Additionally, motor dominance is observed in the asymmetry of the vergence movement. It seems that these categories are closely related to one another, and furthermore, spatial attention plays a significant role with regard to these ocular dominance categories.

However, if the low quality view is the observer's dominant eye, the masking effect will not work. Based on this human visual characteristic, this paper proposed a GOP-based resolution cross-switching asymmetric encoding scheme. By allocating degradation to both of views in a balanced way over time, our experimental results show better compression efficiency than JMVM reference software and better subjective visual quality than the traditional asymmetric stereo video encoding scheme. Our stereo video coding scheme can be a trade-off between compression performance and subjective visual quality. © 2009 IEEE.

Signal detection theory (SDT) was used to explore the contributions of perceptual (sensitivity shifts) and decisional (shifts in response criteria) factors to this effect, known as the Colavita visual dominance effect. Participants performed a version of the Colavita task that had been modified to allow for SDT analyses. The participants had to detect auditory and visual targets (presented unimodally or bimodally) at their individually determined 75% detection thresholds. The results showed a significant decrease in participants' sensitivity to auditory stimuli when presented concurrently with visual stimuli (in the absence of any significant change in their response criterion), suggesting that Colavita visual dominance does not simply reflect a decisional effect, but can be explained, at least in part, as a truly perceptual phenomenon. The decrease in sensitivity (to auditory stimuli) may be attributable to the exogenous capture of participants' attention by the visual component of the bimodal target, thus leaving fewer attentional resources for the processing of the auditory stimulus. The reduction in auditory sensitivity reported here may be considered an example of crossmodal masking. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

Two studies have shown that this gaze effect is generalized to the nystagmus caused by unilateral cold water irrigation. This indicates that the gaze effect is not the result of central changes associated with a peripheral lesion but rather because of unilateral vestibular peripheral inhibition. In this study, we show that there is a similar gaze effect on the nystagmus produced by unilateral warm water ear irrigation. Furthermore, we examined the two hypotheses of Alexander's Law proposed in the two studies. One hypothesis is based on the gaze-dependent modulation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) response to unbalanced canal input. The other hypothesis, however, is based on the leaky neural integrator caused by unilateral vestibular peripheral inhibition. These two hypotheses predict the same gaze effect on the nystagmus produced by cold water irrigation, but opposite gaze effects on the nystagmus produced by warm water irrigation. Our results support the first hypothesis and suggest that the second hypothesis needs to be modified. Copyright © 2008 The American Physiological Society.

Given that spatial and temporal factors have recently been shown to modulate the Colavita effect, the aim of the present study, was to investigate whether semantic congruency also modulates the effect. In the three experiments reported here, participants were presented with a version of the Colavita task in which the stimulus congruency between the auditory and visual components of the bimodal targets was manipulated. That is, the auditory and visual stimuli could refer to the same or different object (in Experiments 1 and 2) or audiovisual speech event (Experiment 3). Surprisingly, semantic/stimulus congruency had no effect on the magnitude of the Colavita effect in any of the experiments, although it exerted a significant effect on certain other aspects of participants' performance. This finding contrasts with the results of other recent studies showing that semantic/stimulus congruency can affect certain multisensory interactions. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

Asymmetric view coding encodes the stereo views with different quality. It has been shown that the human visual system is able to compensate for this asymmetric view quality and present a good quality 3D video. Asymmetric video coding can be exploited to reduce the bandwidth requirements for 3DTV services. The key factors that affect the asymmetric video coding are the compression algorithms, the human visual system, and the 3D display. We conducted a subjective evaluation of 3D video with asymmetric view quality and encoded using MPEG-2. We also studied the impact of eye dominance on the perceived quality. We show that asymmetric view coding can be used to reduce the bandwidth requirements of 3DTV services based on MPEG-2 view coding.

Biological motion perception can be a useful measure of local and global visual processing since the point-light stimuli that are often used to study this ability carry both local motion and global form information. To investigate the integrity of the biological motion processing system in amblyopia, we employed both detection and discrimination tasks with coherent or scrambled point-light walkers either alone or embedded in different types of point-light masks. These manipulations allowed for control over the amount of form and/or motion information available to the observers that could be used for task performance. We found that amblyopic eyes could process both the global form and local motion components of point-light walkers, indicating intact processing for these stimuli. However, amblyopic eyes did show an increased susceptibility to the addition of masking dots suggesting that segregation of signal from noise is deficient in amblyopia. © ARVO.
"Valle-Inclán F.; Blanco M.J.; Soto D.; Leirós L.";0.0;A new method to assess eye dominance;2008;Psicologica;0;People usually show a stable preference for one of their eyes when monocular viewing is required ('sighting dominance') or under dichoptic stimulation conditions ('sensory eye-dominance'). Current procedures to assess this 'eye dominance' are prone to error. Here we present a new method that provides a continuous measure of eye dominance and overcomes limitations of previous procedures. We presented dichoptic streams of randomly selected alphanumeric characters at rates around 5 Hz and asked observers to detect a particular character. In most subjects, the dichoptic streams of letters did not perceptually overlap, instead many participants were never aware that two letters were always presented. Interocular differences in target detection were evident in most observers, thus targets presented to one eye were always detected while targets presented to the other eye were generally missed. These interocular differences (i.e., eye dominance), were normally distributed and showed high test-retest reliability.

Here, we investigated whether this phenomenon, known as the ""Colavita effect"", also affects people's perception of visuotactile stimuli as well. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants made speeded detection/discrimination responses to unimodal visual, unimodal tactile, and bimodal (visual and tactile) stimuli. A significant Colavita visual dominance effect was observed (i.e., participants failed to respond to touch far more often than they failed to respond to vision on the bimodal trials). This dominance of vision over touch was significantly larger when the stimuli were presented from the same position than when they were presented from different positions (Experiment 3), and still occurred even when the subjective intensities of the visual and tactile stimuli had been matched (Experiment 4), thus ruling out a simple intensity-based account of the results. These results suggest that the Colavita visual dominance effect (over touch) may result from a competition between the neural representations of the two stimuli for access to consciousness and/or the recruitment of attentional resources. © 2008 Springer-Verlag."
Handa T.;0.0;Ocular dominance: A noteworthy binocular function;2007;Neuro-Ophthalmology Japan;0;Ocular dominance has been recognized as being functional lateralization, that is, a tendency to prefer visual input to one eye over the other. It also may be defined as the facility whereby one eye commonly dominates or leads the other. However, this has rarely been discussed as a topic in ophthalmology. Recently, several reports have involved studies that designed ocular dominance tests based on rivalry in the visual field in order to quantify ocular dominance. The results disclosed considerable individual variation with regard to the magnitude of the ocular dominance. There are some clinical approaches that can be used to clarify the effects of ocular dominance in visual function. Further studies are needed to re-evaluate the role of ocular dominance in binocular function.

"Song C.; Yao H.";0.0;Duality in binocular rivalry: Distinct sensitivity of percept sequence and percept duration to imbalance between monocular stimuli;2009;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0006912;Background: Visual perception is usually stable and accurate. However, when the two eyes are simultaneously presented with conflicting stimuli, perception falls into a sequence of spontaneous alternations, switching between one stimulus and the other every few seconds. Known as binocular rivalry, this visual illusion decouples subjective experience from physical stimulation and provides a unique opportunity to study the neural correlates of consciousness. The temporal properties of this alternating perception have been intensively investigated for decades, yet the relationship between two fundamental properties - the sequence of percepts and the duration of each percept - remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we examine the relationship between the percept sequence and the percept duration by quantifying their sensitivity to the strength imbalance between two monocular stimuli. We found that the percept sequence is far more susceptible to the stimulus imbalance than does the percept duration. The percept sequence always begins with the stronger stimulus, even when the stimulus imbalance is too weak to cause a significant bias in the percept duration. Therefore, introducing a small stimulus imbalance affects the percept sequence, whereas increasing the imbalance affects the percept duration, but not vice versa. To investigate why the percept sequence is so vulnerable to the stimulus imbalance, we further measured the interval between the stimulus onset and the first percept, during which subjects experienced the fusion of two monocular stimuli. We found that this interval is dramatically shortened with increased stimulus imbalance. Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows that in binocular rivalry, the strength imbalance between monocular stimuli has a much greater impact on the percept sequence than on the percept duration, and increasing this imbalance can accelerate the process responsible for the percept sequence. © 2009 Song, Yao.

Despite existing research into both types of rivalry, it remains unclear to what extent their underlying mechanisms involve common computational rules. Computational models of binocular rivalry mechanisms are generally tested against Levelt's four propositions, describing the psychopysical relation between stimulus strength and alternation dynamics in binocular rivalry. Here we use a bistable rotating structure-from-motion sphere, a generally studied form of perceptual rivalry, to demonstrate that Levelt's propositions also apply to the alternation dynamics of perceptual rivalry. Importantly, these findings suggest that bistability in structure-from-motion results from active cross-inhibition between neural populations with computational principles similar to those present in binocular rivalry. Thus, although the neural input to the computational mechanisms of rivalry may stem from different cortical neurons and different cognitive levels the computational principles just prior to the production of visual awareness appear to be common to the two types of rivalry. © 2008 Klink et al.

Setting: Private practice, Beverly Hills, California, USA. Methods: This prospective analysis comprised 46 patients having hyperopic LASIK for presbyopia. The distance-dominant eye was treated with a standard 6.0 mm optical and 9.0 mm outer zone for full distance correction with no nomogram adjustment from the final preoperative manifest refraction. In the nondominant eye, an algorithm was used to select the optical and blend zone diameters and the optical zone size-dependent programmed amount of correction augmentation. Variables evaluated at the 6-month postoperative visit included preoperative and postoperative manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE), refractive cylinder, and monocular and binocular near and distance uncorrected visual acuities. Patient satisfaction and spectacle dependence were also evaluated. Results: In the near-corrected eye, the mean preoperative and postoperative MRSE was +1.10 diopters (D) ± 1.20 (SD) and -1.30 ± 0.56 D, respectively, and the mean refractive cylinder, -0.76 ± 0.91 D and -0.36 ± 0.33 D, respectively (P<.05).

The mean uncorrected logMAR distance acuity in the near-corrected eye was +0.38 ± 0.31 (20/50) preoperatively and +0.36 ± 0.25 (20/50) postoperatively (P>.05). The mean binocular uncorrected logMAR distance acuity was +0.30 ± 0.30 (20/40) and +0.01 ± 0.08 (20/20) (P<.0001), respectively. The mean overall patient satisfaction score was 8.8 (scale 1 to 10). After LASIK, no patient reported using spectacles full time for near or distance and 15% reported part-time use. Conclusion: Photopic pupillometry-guided LASIK may be an effective option when considering surgical treatment of presbyopia in hyperopic patients. © 2008 ASCRS and ESCRS.
"Lindell A.K.; Arend I.; Ward R.; Norton J.; Wathan J.";0.0;Hemispheric asymmetries in feature integration during visual word recognition;2007;Laterality;10.1080/13576500701495190;Although the definitive source of the left hemisphere's superiority for visual word recognition remains illusive, some argue that the left (LH) and right (RH) hemispheres engage different strategies during early perceptual processes involved in stimulus encoding. In particular, it is proposed that the LH treats a word as a unitary perceptual group whereas the RH processes the letters comprising a word as a series of individual perceptual units. The present study investigated support for this processing distinction by examining hemispheric strategies for temporal integration using Prinzmetal and Millis-Wright's (1984) feature-binding paradigm. A total of 20 participants identified the colour and identity of a target letter, presented within a three-letter word (e.g., ART) or nonword (e.g., HRF), directed to their left or right visual field. Errors were classified on the basis of whether they involved substitution of a colour present within the stimulus but at a different location (ON error), or the substitution of a colour not present within the stimulus (OFF error). As anticipated, for word stimuli there was a higher proportion of OFF errors associated with trials directed to the RH, consistent with the notion that the LH treats words as single perceptual units and is hence biased toward miscombination of perceptual information present within the stimulus. The pattern of ON errors across stimulus type provided clear evidence of RH sequential encoding effects, with the number of errors increasing markedly across the ordinal position of the letters comprising the stimulus string. As such, these data provide new evidence that the LH's advantage for visual word recognition arises, at least in part, from the ability to encode verbal stimuli as single perceptual units.

There is poor agreement between sighting and sensory dominance and findings are equivocal on the possible neural basis of ocular dominance and its significance. Thus, there are questions on the meaning and importance of ocular dominance. Despite the lack of clarity in this area, ocular dominance is used clinically, for example, as the basis for decisions on monovision in contact lens wear and on treatment of anomalies of binocular vision. Methods: Sighting dominance and three types of sensory dominance (based on resolution acuity, contrast sensitivity and alignment sensitivity) were compared within individuals, with the main aim of determining whether sensory dominance is consistent across spatial visual functions. Results: Our findings indicate that each type of sensory dominance is insignificant in most individuals and in agreement with previous work that sensory and sighting dominance do not generally agree. Conclusion: These results demonstrate not only that different types of ocular dominance are not in agreement but also that in the normal visual system sensory dominance as measured here is insignificant in most individuals with normal vision. © 2008 Optometrists Association Australia.
"O'Shea R.P.; Parker A.; La Rooy D.; Alais D.";0.0;Monocular rivalry exhibits three hallmarks of binocular rivalry: Evidence for common processes;2009;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2009.01.020;Binocular rivalry occurs when different images are presented one to each eye: the images are visible only alternately. Monocular rivalry occurs when different images are presented both to the same eye: the clarity of the images fluctuates alternately. Could both sorts of rivalry reflect the operation of a general visual mechanism for dealing with perceptual ambiguity? We report four experiments showing similarities between the two phenomena. First, we show that monocular rivalry can occur with complex images, as with binocular rivalry, and that the two phenomena are affected similarly by the size (Experiment 1) and colour (Experiment 2) of the images. Second, we show that the distribution of dominance periods during monocular rivalry has a gamma shape and is stochastic (Experiment 3). Third, we show that during periods of monocular-rivalry suppression, the threshold to detect a probe (a contrast pulse to the suppressed stimulus) is raised compared with during periods of dominance (Experiment 4). The threshold elevation is much weaker than during binocular rivalry, consistent with monocular rivalry's weak appearance. We discuss other similarities between monocular and binocular rivalry, and also some differences, concluding that part of the processing underlying both phenomena is a general visual mechanism for dealing with perceptual ambiguity. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Past attention research suggests that eye movements to lateralised targets should be significantly reduced using a dynamic, offset mask, causing a reduction in attentional capture. The current study attempted to replicate past divided visual field language studies using offset masking procedures. Using a basic offset procedure, eye movements were not reduced in Experiment 1. However, Experiment 2 did show a significant reduction in eye movements using a new dynamic offset masking procedure. Low accuracy rates were a concern throughout. In conclusion, horizontal eye movements can be reduced with a dynamic offset procedure but the low accuracy rates and the inconsistent behavioural findings throughout the study suggest that further study and refinement of the paradigm is needed.

A randomized, single-blind, repeated measures study was conducted to evaluate the effect of visual acuity on target discrimination and marksmanship. Subjects were examined for inclusion criteria and equivalent plus lens over-refractions necessary to obtain the five test visual acuity ranges. Qualified subjects fired at randomized target presentations from 50 to 300 m while wearing customized spectacles to yield the visual acuity levels being evaluated. Subjects then rotated foxholes for target discrimination sequences. Randomized targets marked as friend or enemy were presented in like manner for each of the five visual acuity levels. Subjects at acuities better than 0.2 LogMAR were significantly more likely to hit the target than those with acuities equal to or worse than 0.7 LogMAR. Target discrimination results show subjects with acuities between −0.2 and 0.6 LogMAR were significantly more likely to correctly identify the target than those with acuities equal to or worse than 0.7 LogMAR. In addition, those at acuities of 0.0 LogMAR or better performed significantly better than those with acuities between 0.3 and 0.6 LogMAR. Visual acuity significantly affects target discrimination and marksmanship performance. Results of this study closely mirror expected findings based on visual angles with acuities in the range 0.3 to 0.4 LogMAR (20/40-20/50) being the transition zone where performance begins to deteriorate. This performance-based evidence fully supports a vision classification system that mandates eyewear to maximize visual performance for deployable military members. Based on the results of this study, the current U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps vision readiness standards of 20/40 or better uncorrected or corrected vision seems to be a valid choice because it is the transition point for performance in both target discrimination and marksmanship ability. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

In Experiment 1, rival emotional and neutral faces in the background were coupled with grating stimuli in the foreground. Results showed that gratings paired with emotional faces dominated over those paired with neutral faces. In Experiment 2, emotional and neutral faces were presented dichoptically, without being paired with other stimuli. Dominance of emotional faces was observed. Fusion and low-level image differences were ruled out by examining dominance periods of upright and inverted emotional and neutral faces presented as face-house pairs (Experiment 3). Here, face stimuli dominated over house stimuli only for upright face conditions. In addition, upright emotional faces were perceived for significantly longer durations than upright neutral faces. The results provide further support for the influence of emotional meaning on binocular rivalry. © 2008 The Authors.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the association between indices of laterality and reproductive indices. DESIGN: The studied sample comprised 650 Chuvashian women aged 18 to 80 years (mean, 46.9; SD = 16.2). The independent-sample t test was used to compare the age at menarche or age at menopause between individuals with right or left dominance of handedness, dominant eye, hand clasping, and arm folding. RESULTS: No significant differences in age at menarche or age at menopause between women with right and left dominance in any of the studied laterality indices were found. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that simultaneously evaluates the association between dominance in four laterality indices (handedness, dominant eye, hand clasping, and arm folding) and two reproductive indices (age at menarche and age at menopause). Result of our study do not support the hypothesis of a possible association between handedness (and other indices of laterality) and an early age at menarche or age at natural menopause. © 2008 by The North American Menopause Society."

These experiments generalized the topological account of lateralization to different kinds of topological properties (including holes, inside/outside relation, and ""presence vs. absence"") in comparison with a broad spectrum of geometric properties, including orientation, distance, size, mirror-symmetry, parallelism, collinearity, etc. The stimuli and paradigms used were also designed to prevent subjects from using various nontopological properties in performing the tasks of topological discrimination. Furthermore, task factors commonly considered in the study of hemispheric asymmetry, such as response latency vs. accuracy, vertical vs. horizontal presentation, detection vs. recognition, and simultaneous vs. sequential judgment, were manipulated to not be confounding factors. Moreover, left-handed subjects were tested and showed the right lateralization of topological perception, in the opposite direction of lateralization compared with right-handers. In addition, the functional magnetic resonance imaging measure revealed that only a region in the left temporal gyrus was consistently more activated across subjects in the task of topological discrimination, consistent with the behavioral results. In summary, the global topological dominance in the LH is well supported by the converging evidence from the variety of paradigms and techniques, and it suggests a unified solution to the current major controversies on visual lateralization. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA."

Eleven right-handed, right-eyed and right-footed healthy adult volunteers performed, from a standing position, an aiming task under two hand (right and left hand) and three visual conditions (binocular vision, right and left eye monocular vision). Centre of pressure (CoP) displacement, hand kinematics and the target's position were synchronously recorded during performance of the aiming task. Analysis revealed a lower RMS error, a later postural adjustment onset and a smaller centre of pressure dispersion when aiming was performed with the dominant right compared to the non-dominant left hand. On the other hand, no differences on either aiming performance or postural adjustments were noted under the three visual conditions. These results suggest a strong handedness and absence of an eyedness effect on the accuracy of aiming and associated postural adjustments. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Vale A.; Buckley J.G.; Elliott D.B.";0.0;Gait alterations negotiating a raised surface induced by monocular blur;2008;Optometry and Vision Science;10.1097/OPX.0b013e31818e8d2a;PURPOSE.: Falls in the elderly are a major cause of serious injury and mortality. Impaired and absent stereopsis may be a significant risk factor for falls or hip fracture, although data from epidemiological studies are not consistent. Previous laboratory based studies, however, do suggest that stereoacuity is an important factor in adaptive gait. The present study investigates how acute impairment of stereopsis, through monocular blur of differing levels, ranging from 0.50 diopter (D) to a monovision correction affected gait when negotiating a raised surface in elderly subjects. METHOD.: Eleven elderly subjects (73.3 ± 3.6 years) walked up to and negotiated a raised surface under nine visual conditions, binocular vision, one eye occluded and 0.50 D, 1.00 D and monovision correction (mean 2.50 D ± 0.20 D) with blur and occlusion either over the dominant or non-dominant eye. Analysis focused on foot positioning and toe clearance parameters. RESULTS.: There was no effect of ocular dominance on any parameters. Monocular blur impaired stereopsis (p < 0.01), with more minor effects on high and low contrast acuity. Vertical and horizontal lead limb toe clearance both increased under all levels of monocular blur including the lowest level of 0.50 DBlur (p = 0.03) and monovision correction led to toe clearance levels similar to that found with occlusion of one eye. CONCLUSIONS.: Findings demonstrated that even small amounts of monocular blur can lead to a change in gait when negotiating a raised surface, suggesting acute monocular blur affected the ability to accurately judge the height of a step in the travel path. Further work is required to investigate if similar adaptations are used by patients with chronic monocular blur. © 2008 American Academy of Optometry.

Eye dominances were determined by two different methods which were named McManus and a Gündoǧan tests. The reliability of the survey was examined using a test-retest method. • Results: Without sex difference right eyes were found dominant for 128 (71.5%) participants by McManus test. The same subjects were re-tested by Gündoǧan method, the right eye dominance were found for 110 (61.5%) subjects. The results of these two methods were related significantly by Fisher Exact test (P<0.01), with an agreement scores (K=0.256, P<0.001). In females the right eye dominance were found for 74 (67.3%) and left eye were found for 36 (32.7%) by McManus test. When the same subjects were re-tested by Gündoǧan method the right eye dominance was found as 62 (56.4%); and the left eye dominance was found for 48 (43.6%) subjects. McManus and Gündoǧan methods results for females were related significantly by Fisher Exact test (P< 0.05), with a weak agreement scores (K=0.239, P < 0.01). In males the right/left eye dominance were found respectively 54 (78.3 %), 15(21.7 %) in McManus test as it was found as 48 (69.6%), 21 (30.4%) for the same participants when they re-test by Gündoǧan method. (X2 test and Fisher exact test were used for the analysis of categorical data. The agreement between different methods was analyzed with Kappa statistics. Comparison of proportions was made by two proportions z test. P value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. • Conclusion: Without gender difference and also in both females and males marked right eye dominance was observed. The right eye dominance was considering functional laterality may due to the dominance of left hemisphere instead of right hemisphere. It is an important topic future research in laterality, and it may well become an important model system for future research."

Object manipulation and symbolic manipulation techniques based strictly on first person perspective are also generally less efficient than their desktop counterparts. Instead of considering the two environments as distinct, we have focused on the idea that desktop applications will likely need to transition smoothly into full immersion through intermediate states. The Withindows framework uses image-plane selection and through-the-lens techniques in an attempt to smooth the movement of both traditional and immersive applications across transitional states such as desktop stereo and multi-display setups. We propose using a virtual cursor in the dominant eye and a reinforcing cursor in the non-dominant eye to avoid ambiguity problems that have discouraged the use of image-plane selection in stereo. We show how image-plane selection resolves non-linear control-display relationships inherent in some approaches to desktop stereo. When combined with through-the-lens techniques, image-plane selection allows immersive viewpoint management and 2 1/2D object manipulation techniques analogous to those on the desktop. This approach resolves global search and scaling problems inherent in prior through-the-lens implementations. We describe extensions for 6 DOF input devices that do not supersede the default interaction method. We developed a single-authored virtual world builder as a proof of concept application of our framework. Our evaluations found alternate perspectives useful but our implementation of viewing windows proved fatiguing to some users. ©2008 IEEE.

Corneal and crystalline lens shape differ in Down syndrome (DS) compared with developmentally normal populations. This study specifically explored the association between corneal curvature and refractive error for the first time in DS. Methods. Participants were 29 children with 59 age-matched controls (33 males and 35 females; mean age 12.4 ± 1.8 years) and DS (9 to 16 years; 19 males and 10 females; mean age 12.8 ± 1.9 years). Corneal curvature was measured using a hand-held keratometer. Refractive error was assessed by distance static retinoscopy in the control group and Mohindra retinoscopy in the DS group. Results. The DS group demonstrated a high frequency and magnitude of refractive errors (mean DS + 2.52 ± 3.00 D; mean controls -0.46 ± 1.32 D). The majority of controls had little or no significant refractive error. DS cornea were significantly steeper (mean DS 45.62 ± 2.13 D; mean controls 43.10 ± 1.37 D). Neither DS nor control data demonstrate significant relations between corneal and total refractive power (M vector). Astigmatic errors in the DS group were more frequently oblique and demonstrated strong right-left specificity. The DS data did not demonstrate a significant association between corneal and total astigmatism along principal meridians (J0), however, a significant relation was found for the control data (linear regression, r = 0.51, p < 0.0001). No significant association between corneal and total oblique astigmatism (J45) was demonstrated by either DS or control data. Conclusions. The study is the first to explicitly investigate the association between corneal power and refractive error in children with DS. The majority of the DS group have significant refractive errors including an increased prevalence of oblique astigmatism. Corneal curvature in DS is not related to spherical (M) or astigmatic (J0, J45) refractive error. Further research is required to better understand the association between the ocular structures of the DS eye and their impact on functional vision. © 2009 American Academy of Optometry."

A half of the left-leading-eye subjects had shorter latencies of the saccades directed towards the left (ipsilateral) hemifield, whereas only one fifth of the subjects demonstrated shorter latencies ofsaccades towards the right (contralateral) hemifield (53% vs 20%). Only one fourth of right-leading-eye subjects had shorter latencies of saccades towards the inpsilateral hemifield and one fifth of these subjects had shorter latencies of the saccades towards the contralateral hemifield (20% vs 25%). The interrelation between eye dominance and spatial asymmetry of saccadic latencies is revealed.

In addition, since it is sometimes argued that a crossed pattern of eye-hand preference might put children at risk of difficulties in leaming to read, we evaluated the relationship between this pattern and reading achievement in first and sixth graders. Results showed that a majority of children are right-eyed for monosighting, and that intrinsic preference and spatial factor influence the choice of eye. As many children were right- or left-eye dominant, and eye dominance was not related to eye preference. We found no relationship between eye-hand preference and reading proficiency, thus not confirming that a crossed pattern of eye-hand preference might put children at risk of difficulties in learning to read.

Analyses of horizontal and vertical fixation disparities indicated that the most prevalent type of disparate fixation is crossed (i.e., the left eye is located further to the right than the right eye) while the left eye frequently fixates somewhat above the right eye. The Gaussian distribution of the binocular fixation point peaked 2.6 cm in front of the plane of text, reflecting the prevalence of horizontally crossed fixations. Fixation disparity accumulates during the course of successive saccades and fixations within a line of text, but only to an extent that does not compromise single binocular vision. In reading, the version and vergence system interact in a way that is qualitatively similar to what has been observed in simple nonreading tasks. Finally, results presented here render it unlikely that vergence movements in reading aim at realigning the eyes at a given saccade target word. © ARVO.

Groups received combinations of exposed dominant or nondominant hands and right or left prismatic displacement. Following prism exposure (terminal feedback), the authors measured aftereffects for proprioceptive straight-ahead and straight-ahead target pointing for both hands. They measured visual straight-ahead aftereffects, starting from the left and right hemispaces. Results were consistent with the prediction: Visual adaptation transfer and additivity occurred when the nondominant left hand was exposed but not when the dominant right hand was exposed. Visual straight-ahead asymmetry appeared when the dominant right hand was exposed to leftward displacement.

Pinwheel crystallization depends on the overall dominance of one eye over the other, a condition that is fulfilled during early cortical development. Increasing the strength of intermap coupling induces a transition from pinwheel-free stripe solutions to intermediate and high pinwheel density states. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

"Koppen C.; Spence C.";0.0;Audiovisual asynchrony modulates the Colavita visual dominance effect;2007;Brain Research;10.1016/j.brainres.2007.09.076;"Participants presented with unimodal auditory, unimodal visual, or bimodal audiovisual stimuli in a speeded discrimination task, fail to respond to the auditory component of bimodal targets significantly more often than they fail to respond to the visual component. We explored the influence of temporal factors on this phenomenon, known as the Colavita visual dominance effect. Participants performed a temporal order judgment (TOJ) task followed by the Colavita task. The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the auditory and visual components of the bimodal targets was varied and the results showed that the point at which the Colavita effect disappeared was correlated with the point at which participants started to reliably perceive the auditory stimulus as coming first. Furthermore, no Colavita effect was observed at those SOAs where the participants always perceived the visual stimulus as having come first. These results are explained in terms of the unity effect; that is, the Colavita visual dominance effect occurs within the temporal window in which participants bind auditory and visual stimuli into a single multisensory perceptual event. However, within this window, the Colavita effect is larger when the visual (rather than the auditory) stimulus is presented first. © 2007."
Pointer J.S.;0.0;Recognition versus resolution: A comparison of visual acuity results using two alternative test chart optotype;2008;Journal of Optometry;10.3921/joptom.2008.65;Purpose: To quantify the difference between recognition (letter) and resolution (Landolt) visual acuity (VA) in a group of normally sighted subjects. Is it reasonable to assume that the two acuity measures are clinically equivalent? Methods: A pair of 6 m acuity test charts was produced: one comprised letters and the other Landolt broken rings. Construction of both charts conformed to the logMAR design format. Monocular VA was determined for the dominant eye of 300 screened and normally sighted optometric patients aged 16 to 40, each wearing an optical refractive (spectacle) correction. Results: Letter acuity was superior to Landolt acuity (P<0.0001). The mean paired acuity difference was-0.041 logMAR (standard deviation 0.034): the 95% limits of agreement were ±0.067 logMAR units or±3.3 chart optotype. Repeatability was high and similar for each chart type (±2.1 and ±2.4 optotype for letter and Landolt, respectively). Gender, test sequence, and laterality of the dominant eye (left or right) were each non-statistically significant variables. Conclusions: For normally sighted subjects wearing an optimal refractive correction, a bias was recorded in favour of recognition over resolution acuity: the clinical difference amounted to approximately 40% of one logMAR chart line, with similar high repeatability for either chart optotype. We conclude that the assumption of clinical equivalence between letter and Landolt acuity is reasonable under optimum test conditions. © 2008 Spanish Council of Optometry.
"Shneor E.; Hochstein S.";0.0;Eye dominance effects in conjunction search;2008;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2008.04.021;We previously found a dominant eye perceptional advantage in feature search (Vision Research, 2006). We now ask if this advantage extends to difficult conjunction search, which requires focused attention and depends on different cortical hierarchy levels. We determined eye dominance by the Hole-in-the-Card test. Using red-green glasses, subjects viewed a briefly presented, backward-masked, array of red/green dotted squares and filled circles. On half of the trials a filled square target replaced one dotted square. There was significantly better performance when the target was seen by the dominant eye, suggesting its visual processing priority in slow, as in rapid search, perhaps including augmented attention to dominant eye representations. Binocular conjunction targets were found faster than monocular targets, though binocularity-as utrocular information-was insufficient to support reasonable detection levels. © 2008.

Our study replicated and extended prior research by Shimojo, Simion, Shimojo, and Scheier (2003), and Simion and Shimojo (2006). Three groups of participants performed forced-choice decisions in a two-alternative free-viewing condition (Experiment 1a), a two-alternative gaze-contingent window condition (Experiment 1b), and an eight-alternative free-viewing condition (Experiment 1c). Participants viewed photographic art images and were instructed to select the one that they preferred (preference task), or the one that they judged to be photographed most recently (recency task). Across experiments and tasks, we demonstrated robust bias towards the chosen item in either gaze duration, gaze frequency or both. The present gaze bias effect was less task specific than those reported previously. Importantly, in the eight-alternative condition we demonstrated a very early gaze bias effect, which rules out a postdecision response-related explanation.

In this study the possible relationships among handedness, eye dominance, and crossed and non-congruent hand-eye dominance in patients with schizophrenia are investigated. A total of 88 patients with schizophrenia and 118 controls were included in the study. The patient group included 60 men and 28 women who ranged in age from 17 to 63 years. Diagnoses were made on the basis of information provided from clinical interviews and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Handedness was ascertained by using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Eye dominance was measured only by the near-far alignment test. Patients with schizophrenia had a significantly increased frequency of mixed-handedness and decreased frequency of both right- and left-handedness in comparison with controls. Also, the male patients with schizophrenia had significantly increased frequencies of left eye dominance, crossed hand-eye dominance, and non-congruent hand-eye dominance compared to controls, but not the female patients. Cerebral lateralisation abnormalities in schizophrenia may be associated with sex-related hormonal factors.

METHODS: Six subjects with MH who were between 18 years and 65 years of age and three age-matched subjects with normal vision were recruited for the study. Vision and macular structure of the better eye of the subjects with MH and the dominant eye of age-matched subjects with normal vision were assessed. High contrast visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were measured using Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study and Pelli-Robson charts, respectively. The Micro Perimeter (Nidek Technologies MP-1) was used to assess macular sensitivity and fixation stability. Using optical coherence tomography, macular thickness and relative retinal thickness at fixation were measured. RESULTS: Subjects with MH had significantly reduced visual acuity and macular sensitivity compared with age-matched subjects with normal vision. In comparison with their age-matched counterparts, subjects with MH had significantly increased macular thickness and increased relative retinal thickness at fixation. A normal foveal architecture was absent in three subjects with MH (50%). CONCLUSION: Patients with MH secondary to ROP have increased macular thickness and reduced vision.

A similar fluctuation occurs when two patterns are presented to a single eye (i.e., monocular rivalry), or when they are swapped rapidly and repeatedly between the eyes (i.e., stimulus rivalry). Although all these cases lead to rivalry, in quantitative terms these modes of rivalry are generally found to differ significantly. We studied these different modes of rivalry with identical intermittently shown stimuli while varying the temporal layout of stimulation. We show that the quantitative differences between the modes of rivalry are caused by the presence of monocular interactions between the rivaling patterns; the introduction of a blank period just before a stimulus swap changed the number of rivalry reports to the extent that monocular and stimulus rivalries were inducible over ranges of spatial frequency content and contrast values that were nearly identical to binocular rivalry. Moreover when monocular interactions did not occur the perceptual dynamics of monocular, binocular, and stimulus rivalries were statistically indistinguishable. This range of identical behavior exhibited a monocular (∼50 ms) and a binocular (∼350 ms) limit. We argue that a common binocular, or pattern-based, mechanism determines the temporal constraints for these modes of rivalry. © ARVO."

Four visual (both eyes, dominant eye, non-dominant eye, and no vision) conditions were tested during GVS in five healthy subjects while focusing on a target placed in front of them. GVS evoked similar upper body postural sway during both monocular and no vision conditions that were significantly greater to those during binocular vision. Changes in ground reaction forces to the anode side followed that same trend, although data for vision with the dominant eye were not significantly different from that for binocular vision. These data suggest an increase in the weighting of vestibular afferent information during monocular vision for standing postural control. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Peters M.; Simmons L.W.; Rhodes G.";0.0;Preferences across the menstrual cycle for masculinity and symmetry in photographs of male faces and bodies;2009;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0004138;Background: Previous studies have shown that women increase their preference for masculinity during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. Evidence for a similar preference shift for symmetry is equivocal. These studies have required participants to choose between subtle variations in computer-generated stimuli, and preferences for more natural stimuli have not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our study employed photographs of individual males to investigate women's preferences for face and body masculinity and symmetry across the menstrual cycle. We collected attractiveness ratings from 25 normally cycling women at high- and low-fertility days of the menstrual cycle. Attractiveness ratings made by these women were correlated with independent ratings of masculinity and symmetry provided by different sets of raters. We found no evidence for any cyclic shift in female preferences. Correlations between attractiveness and masculinity, and attractiveness and symmetry did not differ significantly between high- and low-fertility test sessions. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between high- and low-fertility ratings of attractiveness. Conclusions: These results suggest that a menstrual cycle shift in visual preferences for masculinity and symmetry may be too subtle to influence responses to real faces and bodies, and subsequent mate-choice decisions. © 2009 Peters et al.
"Arnold D.H.; James B.; Roseboom W.";0.0;Binocular rivalry: Spreading dominance through complex images;2009;Journal of Vision;10.1167/9.13.1;When different images are presented to the two eyes, each can intermittently disappear, leaving the other to dominate perception. This is called binocular rivalry. When using radial gratings, focal contrast increments can trigger a traveling wave of perceptual dominance change, originating at the locus of the contrast increment and circling the stimulus. This has been linked to a sweep of activity through V1 that can be traced via fMRI. The dominance of more complex images, like human faces, has been linked to higher level processing structures characterized by more holistic object centered properties. We therefore decided to assess how dominance would spread through more complex images. Using Kanisza squares and human faces we found that dominance tended to spread gradually away from the locus of the contrast increment, often along real or illusory contours. We also found that perceptual dominance was slow to spread between facial regions encoded by different monocular channels. These data are consistent with low-level monocular mechanisms, like those found in V1, playing a determinant role in the spread of perceptual dominance through complex images during binocular rivalry. © ARVO.

The subject population was composed of 110 females (61.5%) and 69 males (38.5%) volunteered for examination. Eye dominance was determined by two different methods named Gündoǧan and McManus tests. Handedness was also determined by two different methods as Edinburgh Handedness Inventory Oldfield (1971) and McManus tests. The reliability of the survey was examined using a test-retest method. • RESULTS: Without gender difference right/left eye dominance were found respectively for 110 (61. 5%), 69 (38.5%) subjects by Gündogan test. When the same subjects were re-tested by McManus method the right/left eye dominance was found respectively for 128 (71.5%), 51 (28.5 %). The results of these two methods were related significantly, with an agreement score κ=0. 256 (P < 0.01 ). In females the right/left eye dominance were found respectively as 62 (56.4%), 48 (43.6%) by Gündoǧan test as it was found respectively 74 (67.3%), 36 (32.7%) for the same subjects when re-tested by McManus test method. The results of these two tests for females were related significantly by Fisher exact test (P < 0.05), with agreement score κ= 0.239 (P < 0.01). In males the right/left eye dominance were found respectively as 48 (69.6%), 21 (30.3%) in Gündoǧan test method as it was found 54 (78.3%), 15(21.7%) for the same subjects when re-tested by McManus test ( P > 0.05). Right handedness ratios were 91.6% (n = 164) and 91.1% (n = 163) in Oldfield and McManus tests, respectively. Statistical agreement between these two methods was also represented with a high score (κ =0.753, P< 0.01 ). The statistical relationship correlation between eye dominance and throwing hand was found significant by McManus test methods (Fisher exact test P<0.017) with an agreement score phi =0.193, P<0.05. • CONCLUSION: The marked right handedness was observed among university students in both two hand preference tests. According to McManus test the throwing hand seems to have more consistent relation with the right eye dominance. Throwing hand and dominant eye seems to be a most reliable way for detecting functional asymmetry and cerebral laterality.

Blur, disparity and looming cues were presented in combination or separately to asses their contributions to the total near response in a within-subjects design. Response gain for both vergence and accommodation reduced markedly whenever disparity was excluded, with much smaller effects when blur and proximity were excluded. Despite the clinical homogeneity of the participant group there were also some individual differences. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There is no established disease-modifying treatment of xerostomia and xerophthalmia in SS. This retrospective study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ for glandular function, i.e. saliva and tear production. Methods. Fourteen patients with primary SS (pSS) were included (Group A). All patients were anti-Ro and/or -La antibody positive except one. Patients were treated with HCQ for a period of up to 6 months. Glandular function was determined by Saxon's and Schirmer's tests for the dominant eye at baseline and at the end of the treatment. We included a control group of 21 patients with objective sicca symptoms and positive α-fodrin antibodies (Group B). Results. In patients with pSS (Group A), a significant increase in saliva production after HCQ treatment (P = 0.022) was observed. A subanalysis revealed that particularly the α-fodrin-positive patients responded to HCQ (P = 0.017 α-fodrin positive vs P = 0.4 α-fodrin negative). Interestingly, patients with sicca symptoms and α-fodrin antibodies (Group B) showed a significant increase in tear production (P = 0.001). In addition, there was a positive correlation between the α-fodrin IgA antibody concentration and the Schirmer's test at baseline (r = 0.66; P = 0.001) and after treatment (r = 0.6; P = 0.004) in this group. Conclusions: HCQ treatment led to a beneficial effect on xerostomia in patients with pSS who lack severe organ manifestations.

These observers weigh one eye more than the other when determining the visual directions of stereo objects. This unequal weighting has been called ocular prevalence. We considered that ocular prevalence might be asymmetric, that is, different for crossed and uncrossed stereo disparities. Methods: We examined 11 subjects with normal eyes and a stereo resolution of less than 100 sec arc. A vertical line was dichoptically presented for 100 ms at crossed or uncrossed stereo disparities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 min arc; this stereo object was judged in relation to a reference line in the fixation plane. Results: Ten of the 11 subjects had ocular prevalence, but only 3 of the 10 showed a significant difference between crossed and uncrossed disparities. Conclusions: Ocular prevalence occurs frequently among observers with normal binocular vision, but only a minority of these observers show a difference between crossed and uncrossed disparities of the stereo object. It is unclear whether this difference bears clinical importance. Copyright © 2008 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

Participants performed antisaccades before and on 6th day of dry immersion (DI). The analysis of saccade characteristics and event-related desynchronization (ERD) was performed within theta, alpha, and beta bands. Certain increase of errors percent and saccade latencies was observed in DI in LE group but not in RE one. In control conditions two ERD foci were observed - in occipital and frontal areas, with maximal values in occipital areas in alpha range. ERD magnitude sharply decreased in both groups in DI. ERD amplitude was lower in LE group as compared to RE one under control and microgravity conditions, especially in right anterior regions in DI. The ERD magnitude decline may be interpreted as decrease of cortical activation level. Thus, cortical processes associated with saccadic control were greatly disturbed in microgravity in subjects with left eye dominance.

Recent research has demonstrated that familiar and recognizable stimuli such as upright faces and words in a native language could break interocular suppression faster than their matched controls. In this study, a visible word prime was presented binocularly then replaced by a high-contrast dynamic noise pattern presented to one eye and either a semantically related or unrelated word was introduced to the other eye. We measured how long it took for target words to break from suppression. To investigate word-parts priming, a second experiment also included word pairs that had overlapping subword fragments. Results from both experiments consistently show that semantically related words and words that shared subword fragments were faster to gain dominance compared to unrelated words, suggesting that words, even when interocularly suppressed and invisible, can benefit from semantic and subword priming. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, performance on a visuo-spatial memory task was compared in congenitally monocular individuals and sighted control individuals viewing monocularly (i.e., patched) and binocularly. The task required the individuals to view and memorize a series of target locations on two-dimensional matrices. Overall, congenitally monocular individuals performed worse than sighted individuals (with a specific deficit in simultaneously maintaining distinct spatial representations in memory), indicating that the lack of binocular visual experience affects the way visual information is represented in visuo-spatial memory. No difference was observed between the monocular and binocular viewing control groups, suggesting that early monocular deprivation affects the development of cortical mechanisms mediating visuo-spatial cognition. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Patients and Methods: 13 cataract patients with a monofocal intraocular lens in one eye (SA60AT, Alcon) and postoperative emmetropia received a multifocal lens in the second eye (ReSTOR, Alcon). Two and six months postoperatively the clinical examination, far and near vision, near aniseikonia (AWAYA-New Aniseikonia Test), stereo vision (Lang I test) and the mesopic contrast sensitivity (F.A.C.T) were tested. In addition, the grade of satisfaction without glasses in general, and with far and near vision were noted on a visual analogue scale (0-10). Furthermore, independence from glasses and the presence of optical phenomena were assessed. Results: The mean uncorrected far visual acuity 6 months postoperatively was 1.06 ± 0.28 for the monofocal lens, 0.88 ± 0.23 for the multifocal lens, and 1.16 ± 0.24 binocularly. The uncorrected near visual acuity was Nieden 1 binocularly for all patients and ranged from Nieden 1-3 for the multifocal lens to Nieden 2-11 for the monofocal lens. 77% of the patients received the multifocal lens in their far dominant eye. The mean uncorrected near aniseikonia was <1%. The mesopic contrast sensitivity showed no significant differences between the two IOL types and compared to binocular values. The satisfaction with the uncorrected visual acuity was in general 8.88 ± 1.21, with the far visual acuity 9.42 ± 1.24, and 7.33 ± 1.72 with the near visual acuity. After 6 months 67% of the patients used glasses only for periods of prolonged reading. Halos and a low degree of glare were noted by 38.5% of patients 2 months postoperatively. At the 6 months visit 33.3% still had halos and only 8% glare. Conclusions: This first experience with the combined implantation of a monofocal and a multifocal lens revealed a marked improvement of the uncorrected near visual acuity compared to bilateral monofocal IOL implantation along with a high patient satisfaction. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

We also evaluated the familial correlation and heritability of aforementioned traits in the studied population. The investigated cohort comprised 235 nuclear Chuvashian (Russia) families and included 595 men aged 18-89 years (mean 46.9) and 592 women aged 18-90 years (mean 48.5). Our study shows that in the Chuvashian population right handedness, right dominant eye, right hand clasping and left arm folding is a most frequent pattern. In the studied population 9.08 % of males and 9.98 % of females were left-handed. Left DE was observed in 22.84 % of males and 21.81 % of females. Left dominance in HCL was found in 47.63 % of males and 49.32 % of females, while left dominance in ARMF was in 52.02 % of males and 58.98 % of females. The frequencies of dominance in HDD, DE and HCL showed no statistically significant differences between the sexes, but we found a significant sex difference in ARMF (p = 0.016). Statistically significant correlations were found between dominances of HDD and HCL, HDD and DE, and HCL and DE. No confirmation of heritability was obtained concerning the DE, HCL or ARMF indices. However, we obtained a high heritability estimate for HDD (h2 = 0.19) that was based on statistically significant parent-offspring and sib-sib correlations. © 2008 E.

Pointer J.S.;0.0;Sensori-motor lateral preferences of amateur motorspot drivers;2008;Research Journal of Medical Sciences;0;Vision-related aspects of motorsport activity have been little reported. We consider here oculo-visual influence upon hand and foot action for the kart racing driver as investigated through an assessment of patterns of sensori-motor lateral preference. Functional lateral preferences for eye, hand and foot were determined by a self-administered questionnaire, initially amongst a population of kart racing drivers (N = 60, 90% males, aged 10-52 years) and subsequently for a matched control group of optometric patients. Further comparative laterality data were located in a published study of healthy male subjects in the general population (N = 2,756, 94% aged 8-55 years). For each modality the kart drivers recorded no statistically significant difference in degree of right preference compared to either the matched control group or the larger general population, 70% were right-eyed, 85% right-footed and 90% right-handed. Lateral congruency of sensori-motor combinations was statistically similar in motorsport and non-participating individuals, being only slightly more ipsilateral than chance would predict. Patterns of lateral association between the sighting eye and the preferred upper/ lower limbs of kart drivers were no different to those recorded for a non-motorsport population. This outcome is considered in the context of the physical restrictions imposed on the driver by the race equipment and the specific motion dynamics of competitive kart racing. © Medwell Journals, 2008.

Methods: The perception of visual illusion (i.e., illusory line motion) in the dominant and nondominant eyes was examined in 12 control subjects (under 5Δ), 12 exophoria patients (over 10Δ), and 12 exotropia patients. This paradigm presents two cues followed by an instantaneously presented horizontal bar, which the subjects perceive as bars that emanate from the two priming cues. These bars appear to grow toward the center of the visual field and continue to move inward until they collide with each other. In these experiments, the priming cues were asynchronously and simultaneously presented. Results: In the dominant eye, there was no correlation between the collision point shift and the ocular deviation, regardless of the stimulus patterns. However, a correlation was noted between the collision point shift and the ocular deviation in the nondominant eye when the second cue was presented in the nasal hemi-retina (P < 0.01). The shift of the collision point in exophoria and exotropia was greater than that seen in the control subjects (P < 0.01). When there was simultaneous presentation of the two cues in the nasal and temporal hemi-retina, there was a difference in the shift of the collision point in the exotropia patients, as compared to both the control subjects and exophoria patients (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Current findings strongly suggest that sensory adaptation in the nondominant eye compensates for visual stress with ocular deviation. © 2009 Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

We demonstrate how the models with weak lateral interactions can be reduced to the models with corresponding weak elastic interactions. Namely, the batch version of soft topology-preserving map can be rigorously reduced to the elastic net. Owing to the latter, both models produce similar behaviour when applied to the TSP. Unlike, the incremental (online) version of soft topology-preserving map is reduced to the cortical map only in the limit of low temperature, which makes their behaviours different when applied to the ocular dominance formation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.
"Marchetti C.; Carey D.; Della Sala S.";0.0;Crossed right hemisphere syndrome following left thalamic stroke;2005;Journal of Neurology;10.1007/s00415-005-0656-8;In most right-handed people, language and motor functions are more reliant on systems of the left hemisphere while several non-linguistic visuo-spatial and attentional processes depend more on the right hemisphere. The rare exceptions to these rules provide important clues as to what functions co-lateralise, and are thus crucial for models of cerebral specialization. Here we report on the case of a patient, who, after a lesion restricted to the left thalamic region, showed signs normally associated with right hemispheric injury including motor impersistence, visuo-spatial dysfunction and poor comprehension of facial expression. Language abilities were spared and no signs of apraxia were present, in spite of his right hand, foot and eye preference, a pattern normally associated with conventional cerebral dominance. In spite of his other right hemispheric signs, the patient showed no signs of hemispatial neglect. The patient's pattern of spared and impaired abilities is compared and contrasted with other rare cases of crossed right hemisphere syndrome.

METHODS: This prospective, comparative, randomized study included 250 eyes of 125 patients with bilateral cataracts. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IOLs with a spherical biconvex optic (Acrysof SN60AT [Alcon] or Sensar AR40e [Advanced Medical Optics, AMO]) or IOLs with an aspheric optic (Acrysof IQ SN60WF [Alcon], Tecnis Z9000 [AMO], or Sofpott L161A0 [Bausch & Lomb]). Ophthalmologic examination including best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, pupil size, ocular dominance investigation, contrast sensitivity under mesopic and photopic conditions, and wavefront analysis was performed 2 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Aspheric IOLs showed better contrast sensitivity compared to spherical IOLs at spatial frequencies of 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) under photopic conditions and at all spatial frequencies under mesopic conditions. There was no significant difference among the three aspheric IOLs at all spatial frequencies under either photopic or mesopic conditions. Mean total spherical aberration was statistically lower in dominant eyes with aspheric IOLs (0.05±0.06, 0.11±0.1, and 0.19±0.08 μm for the Tecnis Z9000, Acrysof IQ SN60WF, and Sofport L161AO, respectively) compared with eyes with spherical IOLs (0.62±0.24 and 0.46±0.19 μm for the Acrysof SN60AT and Sensar AR40e, respectively) for a 5-mm pupil diameter. CONCLUSIONS: The aspheric IOLs had less wavefront aberrations and performed better under both photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity compared to the spherical IOLs. These findings confirm it is possible to improve the optical performance of IOLs by modifying the surfaces.

Here we examine mechanisms that may underpin these effects in both clinical and non-clinical child populations. Unilateral spatial inattention (unilateral neglect) is a commonly reported consequence of stroke in adults. Although for most patients the problem is relatively transient, persistent forms of neglect are almost exclusively associated with right hemisphere lesions. It has been suggested that this chronicity may result from co-existing disruption to right hemisphere dominant systems that mediate alertness. Here we present two studies examining the relationship between sustained attention and left spatial awareness in childhood. Method: In the first, normal children without the ADHD diagnosis were administered a non-spatial test of sustained attention/alertness. Children who performed poorly at this task, relative to their more attentive peers, showed a modest but reliable delay in awareness of left-sided visual information. Furthermore, attention towards the left declined for both groups as a function of time-on-task, suggesting a significant within-subject modulatory effect of alertness on spatial awareness. The second study examines this relationship in children referred to clinical services for attention problems. Irrespective of their final diagnosis, children were divided into two groups according to their performance in sustained attention/alertness tasks. Results: The results suggest that, regardless of the children's clinical diagnosis, diminished sustained attention/alertness levels formed the strongest predictor of relatively delayed awareness of information presented within left visual space. Two children within this group exhibited signs of hitherto undetected spatial neglect as severe as that observed in some brain-injured adults. Conclusions: Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed. © 2005 Association for Child Psychology and Psychiatry.

In this paper we study the applicability of this cell to form feature specific clusters and show how an array of these cells when connected through an RC-network, interacts diffusively so as to form clusters similar to those observed in cortical ocular dominance maps.

SETTING: Department of Orthoptics and Visual Science, School of Allied Health Sciences, Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. METHODS: Contrast sensitivities were measured by having subjects view contrast charts at spatial frequencies of 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, and 18.0 cycles per degree after the addition of positive spherical lenses that ranged from +1.0 to +3.0 diopters (D). Through the use of a balance technique, the test group was quantitatively divided into 12 weak and 8 strong ocular dominance subjects on the basis of binocular rivalry. RESULTS: In study 1, binocular contrast sensitivity was measured in the weak and strong ocular dominances by adding a positive spherical lens in front of 1 eye, whereas the other eye was fixed at a corrected distance. In study 1, the binocular summation was observed only after adding positive spherical lenses in the nondominant eye. The differences in binocular contrast sensitivity that occurred after adding a positive spherical lens in the dominant eye versus that seen in the nondominant eye were statistically significant in the strong ocular dominance subjects who had +1.5 D and +2.0 D defocuses (P<.05; analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS: Binocular summation was effectively maintained with reading adds in the nondominant eye and was significantly influenced by the magnitude of ocular dominance. Evaluating binocular summation after monocular reading adds seems to be a good method to evaluate adaptability to monovision. © 2005 ASCRS and ESCRS."

The primary objective of this study was to show better finger-tapping performances in right-handed participants with best verbal IQ values. We found that it was not the non-verbal but the verbal abilities that were related to finger-tapping performances. This was proven, especially as to the left-hand taps. Faster left-hand taps in participants with higher verbal IQ values may be due to a closer cooperation of right-hemispheric regions in information processing and an intimate relationship between language and finger-motor functions. Secondary objectives assessed by explorative data analyses included gender differences and hand - eye preference. While in the females left-hand taps correlated somewhat more with verbal IQ values, in the males this effect was seen in selected variables of the right-hand taps. Moreover, laterality assessed in finger-tapping performances may not be in accordance with laterality found in the handedness questionnaire. In addition to this, congruent hand-eye dominance was found to be slightly more prevalent in participants with best verbal IQ values. However, these findings will have to be confirmed in further experiments.
"Rhode L.; Elias L.J.";0.0;Visual bisection of freely-viewed asymmetrical stimuli;2007;Laterality;10.1080/13576500701317758;When performing line bisection tasks, neurologically normal individuals exhibit leftward biases. Similarly, normals also exhibit leftward biases during judgements of brightness, numerosity, and size. However, when these same judgement stimuli are visually bisected, this results in rightward bisection biases. These apparently contradictory results are complicated by the fact that bisection tasks are typically performed using single stimuli, whereas judgements of brightness, numerosity, and size are performed on pairs of stimuli. The present study examined the effects of visual bisection on pairs of stimuli. A sample of 34 undergraduate psychology volunteers exhibited leftward biases when making judgements of brightness, numerosity, and size. However, these same participants did not exhibit leftward bisection biases with the same stimuli. Instead, overall rightward bisection errors were observed. These results indicate that although these two types of tasks elicit similar perceptual biases, they are probably the result of different perceptual mechanisms.

In this study, the possible relationships among handedness, eyedness and nasal cycle in autism have been investigated. Materials and methods: Thirty-seven children with autism and 20 controls were included in the study. The patient group included 27 boys and 10 girls who ranged in age from 5 to 20 years. For hand preference, hand used to write and throw a ball was accepted as dominant hand. For eye preference or dominance, eye used to look through keyhole of a door was accepted as dominant eye. Nasal dominance was assessed by a method of measuring the nasal airflow. Results: The rates of left-handedness and left-eyedness were higher in children with autism compared to normal populations. A majority of children with autism had left nasal dominance. Conclusion: Autism and early language impairment may be associated with left handedness, eyedness and nasal dominance. © 2007 ISDN.
McLaurin A.;0.0;America through british eyes: Dominance and subordination in british political cartoons of the 1940s;2007;Journalism Studies;10.1080/14616700701504625;Political cartoons of the 1940s offer a rich seam of material enabling us to understand some of the ways in which America figured in the British imagination. Although there are many facets to this topic, there is one overarching theme that runs throughout the period, and that is the question of Britain's subordination to the United States. From within a country at the centre of a dwindling Empire, we can find thoughts and feelings expressed in graphic form which registered the seismic shift as America took over a world leadership role. This perception of dominance and subordination in Anglo-American relations has clearly retained its relevance, and many cartoonists practising at the present time reflect this in their work, as a glance at British newspapers in the course of any week will show. This is often expressed through the depiction of a relationship between the American President and a British Prime Minister who is widely regarded as increasingly presidential, yet subservient to his counterpart. In the 1940s Britain's relative weakness took the tangible form of economic dependency on the United States, and reactions to this situation by political cartoonists such as Low, Illingworth and Gabriel are the main focus of this discussion. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
"Bhushan B.; Khan S.M.";0.0;Laterality and accident proneness: A study of locomotive drivers;2006;Laterality;10.1080/13576500500457458;This study attempted to find the association between four measures of laterality (handedness, footedness, eyedness, and earedness) and accident proneness in locomotive drivers. The Sidedness Bias Schedule was administered to a sample of 80 locomotive drivers to ascertain their preferential bias. Their accident records were also available. Positive correlations were mostly found between the measures of hand, foot, ear, and eye dominance. Analyses suggested that there was a higher accident rate among left-handers and left-footers, with multiple regression unable to determine whether handedness or footedness was related more strongly to accident proneness. However, it was clear that accident rate was primarily associated with direction of lateralisation, and not with degree of lateralisation. Drivers with left-handedness were more likely to be involved in accidents, and it is possible that that may be related to the design of the locomotive cabs.

The performance of 17 patients with AMD was compared with that of 17 elderly controls and 21 young people. Monocular and binocular acuities were measured using a multiple-E optotype test. Binocular ratios, defined as the better-eye acuity divided by the binocular acuity, were calculated. We also measured eye dominance during rivalry (proportion of time the participants reported perceiving the input to each eye) and rivalry rates (number of alternations per minute). The results showed that while overall binocular ratios were similar for the three groups, the frequency distributions of people who experienced inhibition, equality or summation were different for the young and AMD groups. In the rivalry test, patients experienced more piecemeal perception than the elderly and young controls, but time dominance from the better-seeing eye was comparable for the three groups. Rivalry rates decreased with age and further with pathology. Moreover, rivalry time dominance of the worse-seeing eye was negatively correlated with interocular acuity differences for the AMD group. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Material and Methods: A total of 179 subjects (age between 16-24 yr., mean ± standart deviation= 19.37 ± 1.62), 110 females (61.5%) and 69 males (38.5%) volunteered for examination. The right/left hand preference was assessed according to Geschwind Scores (GS) by Edinburgh Inventory (Oldfield, 1971) and McManus tests. The right/left eye dominance was evaluated by the Gündoǧan and McManus test methods. Results: According to Edinburgh Inventory Oldfield test 164 (91.6%) subjects preferred to use their right hands, and 15 (8.4%) subjects preferred to use their left hands. In the McManus test 163 (91.1%) subjects preferred to use their right hands and 16 (8.9%) subjects preferred to use their left hands. There was good agreement between the two methods (Kappa coefficient= 0.753, p= 0.000). When the dominant eye was evaluated with the Gündoǧan method, the right eye was dominant in 110 (61.5%) subjects and the left eye was dominant in 69 (38.5%) subjects. According to the McManus test, the right eye was dominant in 128 (71.5%) subjects and the left eye was dominant in 51 (28.5%) subjects. Although the correlation between these two different methods was statistically significant (χ2= 12.378, p= 0.000), there was a weak agreement between them (Kappa coefficient= 0.256, p= 0.000). The preference of the right hand for throwing and the dominant eye were correlated significantly in the McManus tests (Fisher Exact p= 0.017; phi coefficient= 0.193, p= 0.01). Conclusion: The rate of right hand preference and right eye dominance was significantly high among university students. This functional laterality may be due to the dominance of the left hemisphere.

The display uses dynamic optical correction to reduce the discrepancy, and can present images as if they are actually remote objects. The authors thought the display may assist in recovery from asthenopia, which is often caused when the eyes focus on a nearby object for a long time, such as in VDT (Visual Display Terminal) work. In general, recovery from asthenopia, and especially accommodative asthenopia, is achieved by focusing on distant objects. In order to verify this hypothesis, the authors performed visual acuity tests using Landolt rings before and after presenting stereoscopic 3-D images, and evaluated the degree of recovery from asthenopia. The experiment led to three main conclusions: (1) Visual acuity rose after viewing stereoscopic 3-D images on the developed display. (2) Recovery from asthenopia was particularly effective for the dominant eye in comparison with the other eye. (3) Interviews with the subjects indicated that the Landolt rings were particularly clear after viewing the stereoscopic 3-D images. © 2005 SPIE and IS&T.
"Li A.; Zeng J.";0.0;Advance of amblyopia treatment;2007;International Journal of Ophthalmology;0;• Amblyopia has been defined as a unilateral or bilateral decrease of visual acuity caused by deprivation of pattern vision or abnormal binocular interaction, for which no cause can be detected by physical examination of the eye. Amblyopia is a kind of disease which is connected with growth. The treatment of amblyopia generally involves correction of the underlying predisposing condition followed by a period of deprivation of the dominant eye to promote normal visual experiences for the amblyopic eye.

Using red-green glasses, subjects viewed an array of green and red lines of uniform orientation, with a differently oriented target line present on half the trials. Performance was significantly better when the dominant eye saw the target, especially when the opposite eye saw the distractors. This effect was reduced when only nearest-neighbor surrounding distractors were homogeneous. We conclude that the dominant eye has priority in visual processing, perhaps including inhibition of non-dominant eye representations. © 2006.
"Cherbuin N.; Brinkman C.";0.0;Hemispheric activation and interaction: Past activity affects future performance;2005;Laterality;10.1080/13576500442000319;Previous studies have shown that when hemispheric activation is modulated by a lateralised task performed concurrently with a second task, performance in the second task is affected by the side of the more active hemisphere. This effect is thought to be produced by competition for limited resources required to complete the two tasks and/or by a greater allocation of attention to the hemifield contralateral to the more active hemisphere. Little is known on how task performance is affected by the pattern of activation in the two cerebral hemispheres before a target task is conducted. The present study investigated how manipulation of hemispheric activity influenced performance of a non-lateralised task (letter matching). Greater left hemisphere activity interfered most with performance of the letter- matching task and was more pronounced in the early learning stage. Male participants were most affected by this effect. The results are discussed in relation to hemispheric interaction, functional lateralisation, and allocation of attention. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd.

We analyzed 1291 questionnaires from 653 men and 638 women, aged 8 to 74 years. Despite the cultural pressure against the use of the left hand for food-related activities, the overall frequency of left-hand writers (10.9%) was comparable to that found in the Western world. The frequency of left-hand writers was higher for subjects with one left-handed parent, and even higher for subjects with two left-handed parents than for subjects whose parents were right handed. The frequency of left-hand writers dropped to 5.9% in the older age-group; it was found to be higher in Tunis, the largest and most Occidental city, than in other cities, while left-hand eating was lower in the South than in the Center or in the North. The frequency of left-footers also dropped in the older age groups and was higher in Tunis than in other cities. Eye preference, consistency of preferred-hand use, crossed hand-eye laterality, crossed hand-foot laterality and gender-related differences in lateral preferences were all comparable to Western results. These data suggest that lateral preferences are partly influenced by a genetic factor, but that handedness (and to a lesser degree footedness) emerges from the intricate interaction of several factors including genetic and cultural influences."

Our aims were to investigate the nature of binocular interactions that occur in each group, and the extent to which the characteristics of binocular interactions differ across the groups. The non-tested eye was occluded during monocular (baseline) viewing, and was allowed to view a uniform stimulus with fusion lock in dichoptic viewing. In adults and children with normal vision, acuity under dichoptic viewing was unchanged relative to monocular baseline in the dominant eyes, while acuity of the non-dominant eye improved under dichoptic viewing relative to baseline. The magnitude of dichoptic change in the non-dominant eyes was similar in the two normally sighted groups, but the dichoptic advantage was found to decrease with increasing age within the children tested. Binocular acuity was better than monocular acuity in normal subjects, and a decrease in binocular summation with age was noted within the age range of the children tested. In contrast, the amblyopic observers showed no change in acuity with viewing conditions. The results demonstrate development of interocular interactions during childhood, and wide inter-individual variation in pattern of interocular interactions among anisometropic amblyopic adults. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: We studied visual acuity and sighting dominance in 92 macular disease patients, 27 of whom were assessed for both outcomes. We also studied visual acuity and sighting dominance in 412 controls. Sighting dominance was evaluated using the hole-in-card test. RESULTS: Among the controls, 70% showed right sighting dominance, and 30%, left sighting dominance. On the other hand, in patients with macular disease, right sighting dominance was demonstrated in 51%, and left in 49%; that is, 24% showed sighting dominance of the affected eye and 76%, of the fellow eye. During follow-up, sighting dominance of three of the 27 macular disease patients shifted from the affected eye to the fellow eye, which showed improvement in visual acuity. CONCLUSION: This study raises the possibility of sighting dominance shifting in patients with macular disease. There were differences among cases in the timing of the shift in sighting dominance, indicating that visual acuity may not be the only factor influencing sighting dominance. Further study is needed to confirm the factors contributing to sighting dominance."

Twenty-five sedentary and 24 physically fit subjects, ranging in age 17 to 22 years, participated. Intraocular pressures were measured by a pneumotonometer. Measurements were taken in the morning at about nine (at rest) and immediately, 30 min and 2 h after acute submaximal exercise. In sedentary subjects, IOPs of both right- and left-eyes decreased immediate after exercise, but, these decreases in both eyes continued 30 min and 2 h after exercise. In physically fit subjects, IOPs of both right- and left-eyes increased immediate after exercise, but decreased after 30 min exercise compared to basement levels, and this decrease continued 2 h after exercise. Acute submaximal exercise decreased IOPs of right and left eyes over a period 2 h in sedentary and physically fit subjects. IOP reducing after exercise was different between right- and left-eyes in sedentary subjects. These results suggest that exercise can be used in ocular hypertension treatment.

Using a modified method of limits for discrimination threshold, a maximum mean angle of ocular duction was determined by stepping a target out in 5° steps until an error was reported and thereafter bracketing around the limits of the target identification in 1° steps. A mean threshold value was determined as the angle at which a subject obtained a correct response 75% of the time in two and as many as three trials in each of four randomly presented directions of gaze (abduction, adduction, supraduction and infraduction). Results: A decrease in mean maximum duction angle was found over all age groups in all four directions (p < 0.001), with a steep decline beginning in the sixth decade and almost doubling in the oldest age group tested (80-95 year-olds). The percent of change in mean maximum angle of duction due to age from the 14-19 to the 80-95 year-olds was: abduction 21%, adduction 24%, supraduction 35%, infraduction 26%. Conclusion: Baseline data are useful to differentiate normal changes occurring with age from early signs of disease. Additionally, disease progression and effects of treatment can be monitored.

However, genes influencing sidedness remain elusive. We measured direction and consistency of hand, foot, and eye preference in 584 Mexican-Americans from families participating in the San Antonio Family Diabetes/ Gallbladder Study. Using maximum-likelihood-based variance components methods, we estimated weak (.11<h2>17) but significant heritability for foot preference, eye preference, several hand preferences (writing, drawing, throwing, using scissors, using spoon, striking match), and a composite hand preference trait. Self-reported handedness was significantly heritable (h2=.57), whereas hand preference for opening a box or using a toothbrush or knife was not. Many trait pairs had significant genetic correlations, and all had significant environmental correlations. Using genome-wide multipoint linkage screens using 382 highly informative autosomal STR markers, we identified suggestive linkage signals for drawing (LOD 2.10) and writing (LOD 2.00) hand preference on chromosome 12q21-23, in the region flanked by markers D12S1300 and PAH. A suggestive signal (LOD 2.46) for eye preference occurred on chromosome 22pter, near marker D22S420. No obvious candidate genes occur in these regions. Our results indicate that genes are an important component of side preferences, and suggest chromosomal regions for further investigation.
"Chong S.C.; Blake R.";0.0;Exogenous attention and endogenous attention influence initial dominance in binocular rivalry;2006;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2005.10.031;We investigated the influence of exogenous and endogenous attention on initial selection in binocular rivalry. Experiment 1 used superimposed ±45°gratings viewed dioptically for 3 s, followed by a brief contrast increment in one of the gratings to direct exogenous attention to that grating. After a brief blank period, dichoptic stimuli were presented for various durations (100-700 ms). Exogenous attention strongly influenced which stimulus was initially dominant in binocular rivalry, replicating an earlier report (Mitchell, Stoner, & Reynolds. (2004). Object-based attention determines dominance in binocular rivalry. Nature, 429, 410-413). In Experiment 2, endogenous attention was manipulated by having participants track one of two oblique gratings both of which independently and continuously changed their orientations and spatial frequencies during a 5 s period. The initially dominant grating was most often the one whose orientation matched the grating correctly tracked using endogenous attention. In Experiment 3, we measured the strength of both exogenous and endogenous attention by varying the contrast of one of two rival gratings when attention was previously directed to that grating. The contrast of the attended grating had to be reduced by an amount in the neighborhood of 0.3 log-units, to counteract attention's boost to initial dominance. Evidently both exogenous and endogenous attention can influence initial dominance of binocular rivalry, effectively boosting the stimulus strength of the attended rival stimulus. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Haynes J.-D.; Deichmann R.; Rees G.";0.0;Eye-specific effects of binocular rivalry in the human lateral geniculate nucleus;2005;Nature;10.1038/nature04169;When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, they compete for perceptual dominance so that each image is visible in turn for a few seconds while the other is suppressed. Such binocular rivalry is associated with relative suppression of local, eye-based representations that can also be modulated by high-level influences such as perceptual grouping. However, it is currently unclear how early in visual processing the suppression of eye-based signals can occur. Here we use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with a new binocular rivalry stimulus to show that signals recorded from the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit eye-specific suppression during rivalry. Regions of the LGN that show strong eye-preference independently show strongly reduced activity during binocular rivalry when the stimulus presented in their preferred eye is perceptually suppressed. The human LGN is thus the earliest stage of visual processing that reflects eye-specific dominance and suppression. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

"Pearson J.; Tadin D.; Blake R.";0.0;The effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on visual rivalry;2007;Journal of Vision;10.1167/7.7.2;One extensively investigated form of perceptual bistability is binocular rivalry - When dissimilar patterns are presented one to each eye, these patterns compete for perceptual dominance. Here, we report that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over early visual areas induces alternations during binocular rivalry. The effect of TMS on binocular rivalry was retinotopic, suggesting that rivalry mechanisms are localized in the cortical representation of visual space. The timing of perturbations was highly dependent on individual differences in rivalry alternation frequencies, with more delayed effects found in slower alternators. This finding suggests that both binocular rivalry and TMS dynamics might be contingent on individual differences among observers. We performed an analogous set of experiments by replacing TMS with transient visual stimulation. The results, however, qualitatively and quantitatively differed from those reported with TMS. Finally, we found that TMS over early visual areas does not produce any time-locked effects on another dynamical process - eye-swapping stimulus rivalry. These findings constitute the first causative evidence that binocular rivalry is contingent on neural activity in early visual areas and suggest that binocular rivalry and stimulus rivalry have different neural correlates, supporting multilevel theories of visual rivalry. © ARVO.

Two key forces underlying this process are adaptation of and inhibition between the images' neural representations. Models based on these factors meet the constraints posed by data on dominance periods, but these are not very stringent. We extensively studied contrast dependence of dominance and transition durations and that of the occurrence of return transitions: Occasions when an eye loses and regains dominance without intervening dominance of the other eye. We found that dominance durations and the incidence of return transitions depend similarly on contrast; transition durations show a different dependence. Regarding dominance durations, we show that the widely accepted rule known as Levelt's second proposition is only valid in a limited contrast range; outside this range, the opposite of the proposition is true. Our data refute current models, based solely on adaptation and inhibition, as these cannot explain the long and reversible transitions that we find. These features indicate that noise is a crucial force in rivalry, frequently dominating the deterministic forces. © ARVO."

The emergence of low cost autostereoscopic displays is expected to drive the growth of 3DTV services. This paper discusses key issues that affect the quality of 3D video experience on autostereoscopic displays. The characteristics of the human visual system can be exploited to compress individual stereo views at different qualities without affecting the perceptual quality of the 3D video. The H.264/AVC video coding algorithm was used to compress each view. We examine the bounds of asymmetric stereo view compression and its relationship to eye-dominance based on a user study. This paper also presents the design and development of a modular video player with stereoscopic and multi-view capabilities including a discussion of useful tools for accelerating the development and enhancing flexibility. The experimental results indicate that eye-dominance influences 3D perception and as a result will impact the coding efficiency of 3D video.

Methods: 1 More than 30 subjects were selected from voluntary students major in Psychology of Department of Educational Science, Xuchang College. Twenty-six students, who were interested in the experiment and accomplished one-month training, were finally enrolled, including 14 males and 12 females with the age ranged from 18 years to 22 years. 2 Subjects were divided into dominant eyes and recessive eyes. All the subjects were determined of naked eyes with ""E"" International Standard visual Table for the double eyes' space visual acuity at 5m away. JGW-B1 was used to determine the horary visual acuity with flicker apparatus. The first experiment was conducted on 7th November 2005, aiming at inspecting the spacial and horary visual acuity of all subjects with dominant eyes and recessive eyes. CFF training was conducted in all subjects one hour per day at spare time between 8th November and 6th December 2005, i.e. Subjects' naked eyes were exposed to angular field without considering abnormal anomalopia such as diplopia and automatic action. Subjects rested for 30 minutes every 6 minutes. A second determination of the spacial and horary visual acuity was performed post one-month training. 3 Correlation between spacial visual acuity and horary visual acuity was analyzed with Spearman method, and differences of measurement data in group were compared with paired t test. Results: A total of 26 students were involved in the analysis of results. 1 Changes in visual acuity after training: The spacial visual acuity and horary visual acuity of subjects with dominant eyes were (1.008±0.285) and (37.066±3.856) Hz respectively, which were obviously higher than those before the treatment (0.912±0.341) and (34.211±3.066) Hz, (t =5.13, 10.48, P < 0.01), while those of subjects with recessive eyes were (1.054±0.280) and (34.634±3.579) Hz respectively, which were remarkable higher than those before training (0.923±0.337), (31.280±3.438) Hz, (t =6.85, 5.56, P < 0.01). 2 Correlation between spacial visual acuity and horary visual acuity: They were remarkably in positive correlation before the training in subjects of dominant eyes (r =0.925,P < 0.01), and so was it after the training (r =0.847,P < 0.05); and they were obviously in positive correlation in subjects of recessive eyes before the training (r =0.966, P < 0.01), and so was it after the training (r =0.667, P < 0.05).

Since its first report, there has been vigorous debate over how the brain achieves the perceptual alternations that occur when conflicting images are presented simultaneously, one to each eye. Opposing high-level/stimulus-representation models and low-level/eye-based models have been proposed to explain the phenomenon, recently merging into an amalgam view. Here, we provide evidence that during viewing of Díaz-Caneja stimuli, coherence rivalry-in which aspects of each eye's presented image are perceptually regrouped into rivalling coherent images-and eye rivalry operate via discrete neural mechanisms. We demonstrate that high-level brain activation by unilateral caloric vestibular stimulation shifts the predominance of perceived coherent images (coherence rivalry) but not half-field images (eye rivalry). This finding suggests that coherence rivalry (like conventional rivalry according to our previous studies) is mediated by interhemispheric switching at a high level, while eye rivalry is mediated by intrahemispheric mechanisms, most likely at a low level. Based on the present data, we further propose that Díaz-Caneja stimuli induce 'meta-rivalry' whereby the discrete high- and low-level competitive processes themselves rival for visual consciousness. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Carter O.; Cavanagh P.";0.0;Onset rivalry: Brief presentation isolates an early independent phase of perceptual competition;2007;PLoS ONE;10.1371/journal.pone.0000343;"When the left and right eyes are simultaneously presented with different images, observers typically report exclusive awareness of only one image. This phenomenon is termed binocular rivalry, reflecting the fact that the dominant image alternates every few seconds in a cycle of perceptual competition that continues indefinitely. Despite the apparent continuity in perceptual switching, we now demonstrate that the initial ""onset"" period is fundamentally different to all subsequent rivalry epochs. Using brief intermittent presentations, rivalry dominance shows strong biases such that the same target is perceived with each successive stimulus onset. These biases remain consistent within any given location, but vary across the visual field in a distribution that is stable over multiple weeks but highly idiosyncratic across observers. If the presentation exceeds ∼1 sec at any location, however, the very different and much more balanced alternations of sustained binocular rivalry become apparent. These powerful onset biases are observed with brief intermittent presentations at a single location or with continual smooth motion of the targets. Periods of adaptation to one of the rivaling targets induced local switches in dominance to the non-adapted target. However, these effects were generally limited to the spatial site of adaptation and had less influence over each subsequent cycle of the target. We conclude that onset rivalry is independent of sustained rivalry and cannot be explained by local regions of monocular dominance or memory of past perceptual history, bur rather reflects low-level, spatially localized factors that are stable over periods of weeks. These findings suggest that brief presentation paradigms are inappropriate for their current use in studies of the mechanisms underlying sustained rivalry. However, brief presentations are ideal for investigating early stages of perceptual competition. © 2007 Carter, Cavanagh."
"Nitta M.; Shimizu K.; Niida T.";0.0;The influence of ocular dominance on monovision--the influence of strength of ocular dominance on visual functions;2007;Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi;0;PURPOSE: Monovision is a method of correction for presbyopia. We have reported the advantage of conventional monovision (the dominant eye is corrected for distance). In this study, we investigated the influence of interocular imbalance of dominancy on the visual function. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten healthy subjects without any ophthalmologic disease participated. After cycloplegia, the eyes of the subjects were corrected by soft contact lenses with an artificial pupil (diameter: 3.0mm). The dominant eye was corrected for distance, and the difference in lens power between the lenses was 2.5 D. The subjects were classified into two groups by strength of the imbalance of sensory dominance, which was determined by using binocular rivalry. Binocular visual functions (visual acuity at various distances, contrast sensitivity, near stereoacuity) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Subjects with strong imbalance of sensory dominance showed decreased near visual acuity as well as decreased binocular summation of contrast sensitivity at low spatial frequencies. On the other hand, near stereoacuity was not affected by the imbalance of sensory dominance. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that strong imbalance of sensory dominance interferes with binocular visual functions in monovision. Thus, the evaluation of ocular dominance is crucial for clinical applications of monovision.

The higher prevalences were more salient in younger than in older individuals and in male than infernale individuals.

In this study, the relation of eye dominance with performance and subjective ratings in golf putting was investigated. 47 right-handed Japanese students from a college of physical education putted 10 balls to a drawn circle 3 m away, each under right-handed and left-handed stance conditions. Putting performance was measured by the number of successful putts. After putting in each condition, they rated subjective visibility and feelings of hitting. Analyses indicated that right-eyed subjects had significantly better performance using the right-handed stance than the left-handed stance, whereas left-eyed subjects showed the opposite. Most subjective ratings were more positive with right-handed stance for both right-eyed and left-eyed subjects. These findings suggest that eye dominance could have some influence on putting performance of Japanese novice golfers. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2005.

"Koppen C.; Spence C.";0.0;Spatial coincidence modulates the Colavita visual dominance effect;2007;Neuroscience Letters;10.1016/j.neulet.2006.10.069;The Colavita visual dominance effect refers to the phenomenon whereby participants presented with auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli in a speeded response task sometimes fail to respond to the auditory component of the bimodal targets. We conducted an experiment on the Colavita effect in which the auditory and visual components of the bimodal targets were presented from either the same or different positions (sides) at one of two eccentricities (13° or 26°). Participants were presented with auditory, visual, and bimodal stimuli to which they had to respond by pressing an auditory response key, a visual response key, or both response keys, respectively. On bimodal trials, participants failed to respond to the auditory stimulus significantly more often than they failed to respond to the visual stimulus, resulting in a significant Colavita visual dominance effect. The Colavita effect was significantly larger when the stimuli were presented from the same position than when they were presented from different positions. These results provide the first empirical evidence that the Colavita effect is modulated by the spatial coincidence of the auditory and visual stimuli. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study was designed to determine if the accuracy in left and right gaze recordings from a video-based binocular eye tracking system with eye-head integration would change when observers looked at targets in different viewing fields. We also wanted to determine whether system accuracy was best using the dominant eye, the average of both eyes or an alignment switching strategy for various viewing fields. Bilateral eye and head movements were recorded to determine point of gaze (POG) for subjects viewing targets with the head neutral or rotated left or right with a stationary body (static) or while stepping toward a target and back (dynamic). Constant, absolute and variable POG and rotational errors were determined. Results showed that although errors were highest in the static condition for POG errors and in the dynamic condition for rotational errors, absolute rotational angle errors were similar for static and dynamic conditions, indicating that subject to object distance played an important role in determining POG errors. Furthermore, errors were not consistently lower for a given eye or for a given eye within a specific viewing field for the head rotations performed. Since low errors across the viewing fields were found by averaging left and right errors, it was concluded that this average and should be used in future studies involving relatively small eye-in-head rotations. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Several factors may be responsible for this behavioural bias. The present study tested the role of emotion-perception asymmetries (assessed with a dichotic listening task) in infant holding-side preferences. In order to neutralise the influence of handedness, only left-handers were recruited. A sample of students was compared to a sample of mothers, with a view to demonstrating that hemispheric specialisation influences holding-side biases in left-handers only in a basic holding relationship (population of non-parents tested on an imagination task). The results confirmed the relationship between holding-side preferences and auditory-field advantages solely for students. The role of the holder's characteristics in determining of holding biases is discussed.

Here we report exposure to parts per billion (ppb) levels of limonene oxidation products (LOPs) and the terpene oxidation product methacrolein using blink frequency (BF) as a measure of trigeminal stimulation of the human eye. Ten male subjects averaging 43 (standard deviation 10.5) years were exposed for 20 min to LOPs, methacrolein, and clean air, respectively. A baseline BF was measured prior to and following each exposure (8 min and 4 min, respectively). The subjects were exposed locally in the non-dominant eye and single blind at 20% relative humidity (RH), while viewing an educational film. Blinking was video recorded and evaluated for full sessions of 36 min. Mean BF increased significantly during exposure to LOPs and methacrolein compared to the baseline of clean air, and the findings coincided with weak eye irritation symptoms. Lowest observed effect levels were 286 ppb methacrolein and a 10-min-old LOPs mixture of initially 92 ppb limonene and 101 ppb ozone (O3), which increased the BF comparably by 18% (p = 0.001) and 17% (p = 0.003), respectively. The increase in BF was smaller, although not significantly different, during exposure to LOPs at 50% RH to 20% RH in mixtures prepared from ca. 350 ppb limonene and 300 ppb O3. LOPs may cause trigeminal stimulation and possibly eye irritation at O3 and limonene concentrations, which are close to high-end values measured in indoor settings. The effects may be exacerbated by low RH. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A lower range of convergent fusion was observed in the dominant eye with the higher accommodation. In contrast, a higher range of fusion was observed in the not dominant eye with lower accommodation. The authors think that the phenomenon of ocular unevenness of the range of convergent fusion does not depend on the peripheral part of visual organ. In fact, it does seem to point out to a cortical process. The authors suggest that quantitative tests on amplitude of fusion should be carried out first on the first eye and then on the other. The results obtained from both eyes should be compared with each other."

The purpose of this study was to learn if there are hemispheric asymmetries in how background distraction affects attentional processing. Asymmetries were investigated by having right eye dominant subjects perform line bisections and manipulating the side of background distraction (right versus left), the eye of regard (right versus left), and the type of attention allocated (focal versus global). Overall subjects bisected lines to the left of center (pseudoneglect) and when viewing with the right eye (versus left) deviated more to the left. Subjects had more background distraction when viewing symbol than solid lines. Although overall, bias did not differ with the side of background distraction or the line being on one side or the other, when subjects viewed symbol, but not solid lines, this leftward bias was increased when the line was displaced to the right, thereby increasing the size of the left sided background. These findings suggest that when engaging the left hemisphere by using focused attention and placing the line on the right side, there is more distraction than when the right hemisphere is engaged.

Regular direction errors loaded, with opposite signs, on the same factor as pro-saccadic reaction times and were unrelated to express errors; these direction errors showed substantial developmental changes. Our data contribute with new evidence from the anti-saccade task to the long standing debate on whether ES should be considered as a separate type of saccade. Anti-saccadic direction errors with express latencies can be distinguished from those with regular latencies. Future anti-saccade task research should therefore analyse these error types separately in order to look for further evidence in favour of their conceptual and statistical distinction. © Springer-Verlag 2005."

Eye preference procedure was carried out using two reference points and pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) were recorded using black and white checks, each check subtending 23′. Trace averager was retriggered every 300 milliseconds (ms) with data collection time of 150 ms. The difference in PERG P50 amplitudes between right and left eyes was analyzed using Student's t test. There was no significant difference in PERG P50 amplitudes between the right and left eye dominant subjects as well as no significant differences between the right and left eyes in right eye dominants and left eye dominants, but in the left-eye dominant group the left eye PERG P50 amplitudes were significantly higher in females than males. Although pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials of healthy subjects provide electrophysiological evidence of lateralization in the nervous system, sensory eye dominance seems to have no correlation with macular function.

Method: A preferential looking paradigm was used, where participants viewed nonlinguistic, simple linguistic or complex linguistic events on two screens displaying identical video tracks, but one offset from the other by 3 seconds, and with the single audio track matched to only one of the displays. Results: As predicted, both comparison groups demonstrated significant non-random preferential looking to violations of temporal synchrony with linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli. However, the group with autism showed an impaired, chance level of responding, except when presented with non-linguistic stimuli. Conclusions: Several explanations are offered for this apparently autism-specific, language-specific pattern of responding to temporal synchrony, and potential developmental sequelae are discussed. © Association for Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2005.

The current study clarifies the relation between laterality and schizotypal personality by administering a battery of laterality questionnaires to measure hand, eye, ear, and foot preference in a group of 933 university students. To determine whether the relationship between schizotypy and laterality is limited to self-report measures, performance asymmetries between the hands were measured with tapping rate. There was no difference between dextrals and sinistrals in schizotypal personality, as indexed by the Magical Ideation (MI) scale. MI was higher, however, for individuals with a weak preference for either hand or eye compared to those with a strong dominance. In addition, individuals inconsistent in their lateral preference across modalities showed higher MI scores. Performance asymmetries had no effect on MI scores. This lack of effect was attributed to the inability of performance measures, such as tapping rate, to identify ambidextrals. The results support research linking schizotypal personality to ambidextrality and weak cerebral dominance and demonstrate that the association extends to modalities other than hand preference. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd.

This included the velocity of smooth pursuits, and the latency and velocity of saccades. We defined the dominant eye for each subject by means of the near-far alignment test and 20 subjects showed the right dominant eyes. Although the ocular dominancy was not found in the velocity of smooth pursuit and vertical saccades, the velocity of horizontal saccades in the dominant eyes was faster than that in the non-dominant eyes. These results suggest that the dominant eye is functionally activated prior to non-dominant eye in horizontal saccades at reading distance, which thus indicates the functional dominancy of the dominant eye in conjugate eye movements. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

Increased left or mixed-dominance in schizophrenia suggests possible hemispheric abnormalities associated with the disorder. A related body of research suggests that some indications of lateralization abnormalities may be evident prior to the onset of schizophrenia, suggesting that disruptions in lateralization are inherent to the developmental course of the disorder. We attempted to replicate and extend upon findings indicating differences in lateralization between children who later developed a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n=26) and those who did not develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n=216), among a high-risk and control, longitudinal sample. The rate of left or mixed-footedness, eye dominance, and any anomalous lateralization, but not handedness, discriminated between those who developed schizophrenia spectrum disorders and those who did not. Left or mixed-laterality appears to signal neurological disruption relevant to the development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that synchronous presentation for combined visual and auditory stimulation facilitated responses, and shorter reaction times and higher response accuracies were obtained. When visual and auditory stimuli were presented synchronously but in opposing (left and right) positions, a visual dominance phenomenon was found, such that the subjects responded more often (81%) with faster responses to the visual signal. This visual dominance effect occurred even in the asynchronous condition when the auditory stimulus was presented 200 ms earlier than the visual one. It was also found that response speed and accuracy improved with increasing length of the warning time interval, and when an uncrossed hand posture was used for making responses. The above results were translated into practical ergonomic recommendations for response key layout, warning time interval, and ways of presenting visual and auditory signals to improve control console design. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The stereostimuli are separated either by color-filter goggles or phase separating liquid-crystal-shutter goggles. The stability of the stereoprevalence is studied by artificial step-by-step deterioration of the retinal image quality, particularly in the dominant eye. The stimuli are blurred using spatial Gaussian filtering. The polymer-dispersed-liquid-crystal cell placed in front of the dominant eye induces a controllable light scattering. The stimuli-blurring and light-scattering methods exhibit different influence on the eye ocular prevalence. Blurring causes a smooth change of the prevalence towards the nonblurred stimuli eye. The influence of moderate scattering depends heavily on stimuli color. At a sufficiently high scattering level the instable switching from the prevalence of one eye to the prevalence of the other occurs.

The hypothetical construct of inhibition or reaction inhibition is used to account for the length of the successive phases of left-eye dominance and right-eye dominance. In accordance with Hull's Postulate X.B. it is assumed that the inhibition increases linearly at rate a1 during periods of left-eye dominance and decreases linearly at rate a 0 during periods of right-eye dominance. Two different versions of the proposed model are presented: the beta and the Bessel inhibition models. Inhibition fluctuates between the boundaries 0 and1 in the beta inhibition model and between - ∞ and + ∞ in the Bessel inhibition model. The transition rates λ1(t) for switches from a state of left-eye dominance to a state of right-eye dominance, and λ0(t) for switches from a state of right-eye dominance to a state of left-eye dominance depend on inhibition: λ1(t) = l1(Y(t)), λ0(t) = l0(Y(t)), where l1 is a non-decreasing function and l0 is a non-increasing function. In the beta inhibition model l1(y) = c1(l - y) and l 0(y) = c0/y. In the Bessel inhibition model l 1(y) = u1ey and l0(y) = u 0/ey. Special attention is given to the derivation of the expectation of the stationary phase durations. © 2005 The British Psychological Society.
"Carmi R.; Itti L.";0.0;Visual causes versus correlates of attentional selection in dynamic scenes;2006;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2006.08.019;What are the visual causes, rather than mere correlates, of attentional selection and how do they compare to each other during natural vision? To address these questions, we first strung together semantically unrelated dynamic scenes into MTV-style video clips, and performed eye tracking experiments with human observers. We then quantified predictions of saccade target selection based on seven bottom-up models, including intensity variance, orientation contrast, intensity contrast, color contrast, flicker contrast, motion contrast, and integrated saliency. On average, all tested models predicted saccade target selection well above chance. Dynamic models were particularly predictive of saccades that were most likely bottom-up driven-initiated shortly after scene onsets, leading to maximal inter-observer similarity. Static models showed mixed results in these circumstances, with intensity variance and orientation contrast featuring particularly weak prediction accuracy (lower than their own average, and approximately 4 times lower than dynamic models). These results indicate that dynamic visual cues play a dominant causal role in attracting attention. In comparison, some static visual cues play a weaker causal role, while other static cues are not causal at all, and may instead reflect top-down causes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Eye movements of the dominant eye were recorded using a Skalar infra-red recorder. In the presence of normal BSV, the effect of distractors is significantly larger for saccade latency and accuracy with binocular distractor presentation than for monocular presentations, with no difference between distrators presented to the dominant or non-dominant eye. The implications of these results are discussed with regard to saccade programming. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
"Levi D.M.; Tripathy S.P.";0.0;Is the ability to identify deviations in multiple trajectories compromised by amblyopia?;2006;Journal of Vision;10.1167/6.12.3;"Amblyopia results in a severe loss of positional information and in the ability to accurately enumerate objects (V. Sharma, D. M. Levi, & S. A. Klein, 2000). In this study, we asked whether amblyopia also disrupts the ability to track a near-threshold change in the trajectory of a single target amongst multiple similar potential targets. In the first experiment, we examined the precision for detecting a deviation in the linear motion trajectory of a dot by measuring deviation thresholds as a function of the number of moving trajectories (T). As in normal observers, we found that in both eyes of amblyopes, threshold increases steeply as T increases from 1 to 4. Surprisingly, for T = 1-4, thresholds were essentially identical in both eyes of the amblyopes and were similar to those of normal observers. In a second experiment, we measured the precision for detecting a deviation in the orientation of a static, bilinear ""trajectory"" by again measuring deviation thresholds (i.e., angle discrimination) as a function of the number of oriented line ""trajectories"" (T). Relative to the nonamblyopic eye, amblyopes show a marked threshold elevation for a static target when T = 1. However, thresholds increased with T with approximately the same slope as in their preferred eye and in the eyes of the normal controls. We conclude that while amblyopia disrupts static angle discrimination, amblyopic dynamic deviation detection thresholds are normal or very nearly so. © 2006 ARVO."

Literature involving similar visual conditions (either naturally occurring or through medical intervention) suggest that there are significant unresolved issues that must be investigated to determine if such displays may potentially negatively impact the visual perception of the wearer.

Saladin J.J.;0.0;Stereopsis from a performance perspective;2005;Optometry and Vision Science;10.1097/01.OPX.0000156320.71949.9D;Purpose. A patient can demonstrate a poor stereoscopic test or task performance for reasons inherent within the test/task itself for reasons dependent on normal physiology common to all human subjects, and also for reasons that are outside of normal physiology and are unique or idiosyncratic to a particular person's visual system. This article reviews the literature for the first two reasons, but emphasizes the pathophysiology involved in the idiosyncratic and abnormal reasons. Results. Using control systems analysis, it is shown that deficits in stereoscopic performance can be explained by reference to the quantitative aspect of stereoscopic threshold and qualitative aspects such as speed of response, reliability-robustness, and strength of percept. The relationship between fixation disparity and stereopsis is seen to be central to this explanation. Conclusions. Proceeding from diagnosis to treatment, control systems analysis offers physiologically based explanations for the corrective procedures necessary to ameliorate abnormal conditions. Several topics for applied research in stereopsis are suggested. Copyright © 2005 American Academy of Optometry.

Subjects (n = 36, 18-30 years old) were recruited among students and staff from the University of São Paulo. Inclusion criteria were absence of ophthalmological complaints and best-corrected Snellen VA 20/20 or better. The subjects were tested in three randomly selected eye conditions: binocular, monocular dominant eye, and nondominant eye. Results obtained in the binocular and monocular conditions did not differ statistically for thresholds measured along the protan, deutan, and tritan confusion axes (ANOVA, P > 0.05). No statistical difference was detected among discrimination ellipses obtained in binocular or monocular conditions (ANOVA, P > 0.05), suggesting absence of binocular summation or of an effect of eye dominance. Possible effects of learning were examined by comparing successive thresholds obtained in the three testing conditions. There was no evidence of improvement as a function of testing order (ANCOVA, P > 0.05). We conclude that CCT thresholds are not affected by binocularity, eye dominance, or learning.

The present study was conducted to determine whether infrared functional tympanic membrane thermometry (fTMT) is a measure of lateralised activation sensitive enough to be used in typical cognitive and clinical experiments. A total of 24 participants had their tympanic membrane temperature measured while performing a letter-matching task. Activation in the two hemispheres was manipulated by changing the proportion of matches occurring in the left and right visual fields and by varying the task complexity. Changes in fTMT due to the greater proportion of matches presented in one visual field and due to the modulation in task complexity were detected. These findings suggest that fTMT is a measure of broad lateralised cerebral activation sensitive enough for use in typical psychological studies.

This trend was not found for footedness, eyedness, and earedness. Females were more right sided than males on all indices of side bias except handedness. The preferential use of limbs stabilised during young adulthood but eye and ear preference did not. Three factors were underlying the formation and maintenance of four forms of side bias. Handedness and footedness constituted one factor, and eyedness and earedness were independent separate factors. The first two had highest association and the last two had lowest congruency.

One of these (A) consisted of a conventional pair of diffractive bifocals in which equal amounts of light contributed to the distance and near images in both eyes. Two (B and C) were modified monovision corrections using non-standard diffractive bifocal lenses. The diffractive designs were such that in the dominant eye a greater fraction of light was sent into the distance image and less into the near image and in the non-dominant eye a greater fraction contributed to the near image. The last lens combination (D) was a conventional monovision arrangement, with a single-vision distance correction on the dominant eye and a single-vision near correction on the non-dominant eye. Monocular and binocular high-contrast acuity, contrast sensitivity and stereopsis were assessed at both distance and near with each of the four lens combinations. It was hoped that the modified monovision arrangements (B and C) might yield improved distance and near acuities in comparison with the standard diffractive bifocals (A) while still maintaining good stereopsis in comparison with the single-vision monovision combination (D) and thus allow wearers to achieve better all round visual performance. Although these expectations were at least partly fulfilled, the modest advantages offered by the diffractive modified monovision approach did not appear to compensate for the disadvantages of its greater complexity. © 2007 British Contact Lens Association.

Setting: Eye Clinic, Kitasato University School of Medicine Hospital, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. Methods: The duration of exclusive visibility of the dominant and nondominant eye target in binocular rivalry were measured in 60 healthy volunteers (study 1) and preoperatively and postoperatively in 10 cataract patients (study 2). Rivalry targets were presented directly to the retina of each eye using 2 retinometers. Subjects reported the exclusive visibility of 1 eye target, and the total duration of exclusive visibility for each eye in dominant and nondominant eye trials was evaluated. Results: In study 1, the magnitude of ocular dominance was quantitatively assessed with 4 grades based on differences in total duration of exclusive visibility between dominant and nondominant eyes. In study 2, magnitude of ocular dominance could be evaluated in all cataract patients regardless of refractive and cataract conditions. Magnitude of ocular dominance displayed significant correlations between preoperative and postoperative conditions (simple regression, P<.001). Conclusions: Ocular dominance can be quantitatively evaluated using this new method based on binocular rivalry and retinometers, particularly in cataract patients. Magnitude of ocular dominance may indicate preoperatively whether a patient with cataracts will have sufficient ocular dominance to adjust to monovision correction. © 2006 ASCRS and ESCRS.

However, little is known about equivalent proficiency in left-handers. Therefore, 48 participants (24 right-handers and 24 left-handers) performed aiming movements of the hand without visual feedback. While the variable aiming error tended to be lower for the preferred hand, the constant aiming error was consistently lower for the non-preferred hand. Data are consistent with the idea of a spatial accuracy advantage for the controller of the non-preferred hand. Data from an ambidextrous participant suggest that this functional difference might be innate rather than acquired through practice.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten healthy subjects without any ophthalmological disease were examined. After cycloplegia, the eyes of the subjects were corrected by soft contact lenses (difference in lens power between the lenses: 2.5 D) with an artificial pupil(diameter: 3.0 mm). Visual acuity at various distances, contrast sensitivity, and near stereoacuity were measured while the dominant eye determined by the hole-in-card test (sighting dominance) was corrected for far and near vision. RESULTS: Binocular visual acuity was better than 1.0(20/20) at all distances. When the dominant eye was corrected for distance, the binocular visual acuity at 0.7 m was better than the monocular visual acuity; contrast sensitivity was better within the spatial frequency range of 0.5-4.0 cycles per degree, and near stereoacuity by Titmus stereo tests improved. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dominant eyes should be corrected for far vision for better binocular summation at middle distances, and near stereoacuity."

However, among bilinguals there was a significant difference in the laterality index for Welsh words compared with English words for those participants brought up in a predominantly Welsh-speaking environment, but not for those brought up in a predominantly English-speaking or dual-language environment. We attribute our results to the difference in orthographic depth between Welsh and English. and argue that the transparency of Welsh favours adoption of a left-hemisphere based phonological decoding strategy in reading. Such a strategy is not necessarily used exclusively by readers of Welsh, but is encouraged by regular exposure to the Welsh language on a day-to-day basis.

Horizontal and vertical electro-oculograms were measured using two surface electrodes attached above and beside the dominant eye and referring to an earlobe electrode and amplified with AC-coupling in order to reduce the unnecessary drift. Four directional cursor movements - up, down, right, and left - and one selected operation were realized by logically combining the two detected channel signals based on threshold settings specific to the individual. Letter input experiments were conducted on a virtual screen keyboard. The method's usability was enhanced by minimizing the number of electrodes and applying training to both the subject and the device. As a result, an accuracy of 90.1 ± 3.6% and a processing speed of 7.7 ± 1.9 letters/min. were obtained using our method.

"Gabbard C.; Ammar D.";0.0;Visual cues and perceived reachability;2005;Brain and Cognition;10.1016/j.bandc.2005.07.006;A rather consistent finding in studies of perceived (imagined) compared to actual movement in a reaching paradigm is the tendency to overestimate at midline. Explanations of such behavior have focused primarily on perceptions of postural constraints and the notion that individuals calibrate reachability in reference to multiple degrees of freedom, also known as the whole-body explanation. The present study examined the role of visual information in the form of binocular and monocular cues in perceived reachability. Right-handed participants judged the reachability of visual targets at midline with both eyes open, dominant eye occluded, and the non-dominant eye covered. Results indicated that participants were relatively accurate with condition responses not being significantly different in regard to total error. Analysis of the direction of error (mean bias) revealed effective accuracy across conditions with only a marginal distinction between monocular and binocular conditions. Therefore, within the task conditions of this experiment, it appears that binocular and monocular cues provide sufficient visual information for effective judgments of perceived reach at midline. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

"Habak C.; Wilkinson F.; Wilson H.R.";0.0;Dynamics of shape interaction in human vision;2006;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2006.08.004;Spatial context can alter perceived shape, and temporal context can influence the perception of a stimulus. We sought to determine the time course of shape interactions by using a paradigm in which closed shape contours are laterally displaced over space and time. Target and masks are separated by various stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) values, yielding forward, backward, and simultaneous masking conditions. Results indicate that spatial lateral interactions of shape are amplified by temporal asynchrony, reaching a peak at SOAs of 80-110 ms. Mask amplitude scales all effects and masking is shape specific. When a single mask follows the target, both spatial configuration and mask onset transient are critical in determining depth of masking. When the target is followed by two sequential masks, the possibility of apparent motion determines whether one or both masks drive masking. These findings suggest that temporal interactions of shape are dependent on an interactive combination of shape specificity and transients, that apparent motion plays a modulatory role, and that target shape is determined after a temporal window, not at its onset. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it has been recently claimed that this format of representation is not special to numbers because non-numerical sequences would be spatially coded in the same way. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the effects of left neglect upon the bisection of numerical and non-numerical intervals. Eight patients with left neglect performed a visual line bisection task and three mental bisection tasks with number, letter, and month intervals. The error pattern in the number bisection task, indexed by the modulating effect of interval length, mirrored that of the visual task and confirmed the left-to-right spatial orientation of the mental number line. In contrast, the bisection of non-numerical intervals showed a very different pattern. The results suggest that the spatial layout characterizing numerical representations constitutes a specific property of numbers rather than a general characteristic of ordered sequences. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Chong S.C.; Tadin D.; Blake R.";0.0;Endogenous attention prolongs dominance durations in binocular rivalry;2005;Journal of Vision;10.1167/5.11.6;We investigated the effects of attention on dominance durations during binocular rivalry. In a series of three experiments, observers performed several tasks while viewing rival stimuli to ensure and control deployment of attention. We found that endogenous attention can prolong dominance durations of attended stimulus. We developed a novel single-task procedure where observer's responses in an attentional task were used to objectively estimate dominance durations of the attended stimulus. Using this procedure, we showed that paying attention to the stimulus features involved in rivalry is necessary for prolonging dominance durations - mere engagement of attention during rivalry was insufficient. Finally, we were able to simulate the effects of endogenous attention by doubling the contrast of the attended stimulus while it was dominant. Attention may increase the apparent contrast of the attended stimulus, thereby prolonging its dominance duration. Overall, our results indicate that dominance durations in rivalry can be prolonged when observers are performing an attentionally demanding task on the rival stimulus. © 2005 ARVO.

Methods: The subjects were 31 healthy volunteers ranging in age from 18 to 27 years. The sway of the center of gravity in the upright position was measured by a stabilometer. The tracings of the center of gravity obtained with the stabilometer while the subjects were standing erect for 1 min under several conditions were analyzed. The root mean square (RMS) area of body sway in each case was determined by analysis of the data. The main visual conditions were as follows: with the eyes open; with fixation of the dominant eye or of the nondominant eye; with a binocular or a monocular visual field of 10°; with a binocular or a monocular visual field of 10° and a visual acuity of 0.01; and with the eyes closed. Results: The main results were as follows: (1) The RMS area while fixation of the dominant eye was maintained was significantly greater than that with fixation of the nondominant eye, and (2) the RMS area showed marked differences between binocular and monocular visual fields restricted to 10°. In monocular fixation of the same visual field, the RMS area increased significantly compared with in binocular fixation. Conclusions: Binocular vision with the field restricted to 10° offered the greatest contribution to postural stability, but the nondominant eye was more concerned with postural control than the dominant eye. © Japanese Ophthalmological Society 2007."

The two views required for 3DTV can be compressed using standard video compression techniques. MPEG-2 is widely used in digital TV applications today and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is expected to be the leading video technology standard for digital video in the near future. The compression gains and quality of 3DTV will vary depending on the video coding standard used. While inter-view prediction will likely improve the compression efficiency, new approaches such as asymmetric view coding are necessary to greatly reduce bandwidth requirements for 3DTV. This demonstration will show the quality of 3D video experience on autostereoscopic displays using H.264 and MPEG-2. We will also show the benefits of using asymmetric view coding as well as the role of eye dominance on 3DTV experience. Copyright 2006 ACM.
"Shneor E.; Hochstein S.";0.0;Effects of eye dominance in visual perception;2005;International Congress Series;10.1016/j.ics.2005.05.006;While it is clear that one eye is visually dominant, the function of dominance, if any, is not fully understood. We looked for effects of eye dominance on visual feature search, the easy task of detecting an element that differs significantly in a single dimension from surrounding distractors. Thirteen subjects were tested, each with similar visual acuities in their two eyes. Dominant eye was determined using the Hole-in-the-Card test. Using red-green glasses, subjects viewed a briefly presented 8 × 8 array of green and red lines oriented at 60°. Stimulus duration was varied, and stimuli were followed immediately by a masking stimulus. On half of the trials, one element was replaced by a red or green line oriented at 40°. We tested for differences in performance when subjects viewed the target with the dominant vs. the non-dominant eye. We found significantly better performance when the target was seen by the dominant eye. Surprisingly, this effect was seen for longer stimulus durations, leading to a higher long-duration asymptote. We conclude that the dominant eye has visual processing priority in binocular perceptual tasks, perhaps due to its greater effect in inhibitory interactions between the eyes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A total of 33 patients with +0.75 to +3 D of presbyopia and <0.75 D of cylinder were treated with CK. Radio-frequency current was applied in the peripheral corneal stroma through a probe inserting at 8 to 32 treating spots. The target refraction was 0 D in the dominant eyes, and that of undominant eye was -0.75-2.25 D. Results: At 1 year postoperatively, 30 patients (93%) got binocluar distance uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 0.8 or better and near vision J4 or better. Fifty-four eyes (100%) had a manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE) within ± 1.0 D. The difference between MRSE and target refraction was 0.53 ± 0.34 D. The change of MRSE was 0.10 D monthly. 32 patients (96%) felt very satisfactory or satisfactory at postoperative 1 month. Conclusio: CK is a safe, effective and predicted procedure for correct of presbyopia.
"Thomas N.G.; Harden L.M.; Rogers G.G.";0.0;Visual evoked potentials, reaction times and eye dominance in cricketers;2005;Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness;0;Aim. Few studies have examined the physiology of cricket, including the difference in ability between batsmen to make controlled contact with a ball bowled at high speed. Methods. We therefore measured visual evoked potentials and choice reaction times with dominant eyes, non-dominant eyes, and both eyes together, in 15 elite batsmen and 10 elite bowlers (aged 20.9 SD 1.9 years) and 9 control subjects (aged 20.2 SD 1.5 years). The latency and amplitude of waves N70, P100 and N145 were determined for each visual evoked potential (VEP). In addition interpeak latencies and peak to peak amplitudes were measured. The subjects also completed a choice reaction test to a visual stimulus. Results. We found that cricketers were not more likely to have crossed dominance (dominant eye contralateral to dominant hand) than controls. Cricketers had a faster latency for VEP wave N70 than controls (p=0.03). However reaction time was not different between cricketers and the control group. Across all subjects, in comparison to monocular testing, binocular testing led to a faster choice reaction time (p=0.02) and larger amplitudes of VEP wave N70 (p=0.01). Conclusion. Visual processing during the first 100-150 ms of the balls flight together with binocular vision facilitates retinal activation in talented cricketers.

This study was to evaluate the influence of astigmatism on contrast sensitivity (CS) and higher-order aberrations. Methods: CS, accommodation response and wavefront aberration were measured in 113 patients with astigmatism, aged 18-36 years. Both single and binocular visual performance were examined under four lighting conditions: photopia, photopia with glare, scotopia and scotopia with glare respectively. Accommodation response was classified as normal, abnormal and low. The contribution of the power and axis of astigmatism to CS, accommodation response and wavefront aberration was analyzed. Results: As the dioptric power of astigmatism increased, the loss of CS spatial frequency changed from high to intermediate, and then to low frequency. CS scores varied at different illuminance levels, descending in the following sequence: photopia, photopia with glare, scotopia, and scotopia with glare. However, the normal accommodation group showed better CS values under photopia with glare than without glare. The range of influenced direction of sine-wave gratings remained mostly at the meridian line of high dioptric power, which would be expanded when optical accommadation attenuated. The patients with symmetrical astigmatism got higher CS scores with binoculus vision than with dominant eye vision, while the patients with asymmetrical astigmatism did this only at scotopia with glare. Among higher-order aberrations, coma aberration, secondary coma aberration and the total higher order aberration were influenced by astigmatism, all of which rising with the power of astigmatism increased. Conclusions: Reducing astigmatism might improve the performance of visual function. Not only the power of astigmatism should be cut down, but also the binocular axes should be made symmetrically.
"Brascamp J.W.; Knapen T.H.J.; Kanai R.; van Ee R.; van den Berg A.V.";0.0;Flash suppression and flash facilitation in binocular rivalry;2007;Journal of Vision;10.1167/7.12.12;We show that previewing one half image of a binocular rivalry pair can cause it to gain initial dominance when the other half is added, a novel phenomenon we term flash facilitation. This is the converse of a known effect called flash suppression, where the previewed image becomes suppressed upon rivalrous presentation. The exact effect of previewing an image depends on both the duration and the contrast of the prior stimulus. Brief, low-contrast prior stimuli facilitate, whereas long, high-contrast ones suppress. These effects have both an eye-based component and a pattern-based component. Our results suggest that, instead of reflecting two unrelated mechanisms, both facilitation and suppression are manifestations of a single process that occurs progressively during presentation of the prior stimulus. The distinction between the two phenomena would then lie in the extent to which the process has developed during prior stimulation. This view is consistent with a neural model previously proposed to account for perceptual stabilization of ambiguous stimuli, suggesting a relation between perceptual stabilization and the present phenomena. © ARVO.

It offers the possibility to provide context-sensitive information independently of the user's location and position. Data are presented to the dominant eye on a semi-transparent mirror using a head-mounted display (HMD) unit that works with retinal laser technology. In this study the potential benefits and drawbacks of this new AR technology were evaluated. Materials and Methods: 45 participants without any visual impairment were randomly assigned to 3 groups and completed a variety of tasks during a simulated working day. Group 1 received conventional working aids (paper-based documents) to support the task processing. Group 2 additionally wore an HMD unit that was switched off. Group 3 wore a functioning HMD without any additional aids. Evaluation was carried out by means of a standardised questionnaire (BMS) and a concentration test (""d2 Aufmerksamkeits-Belastungs-Test""). Results: No significant differences between the 3 groups were found in terms of mental strain, concentration-test performance and physical or mental complaints reported in a follow-up interview. Around 20% of the subjects noticed a higher pressure and blurred vision in both eyes as well as headaches. Half of the participants complained about deficiencies concerning the ergonomic hardware design of the AR system. Discussion: Changes in objective ophthalmological investigation parameters were not observed. Subjects reported reduced acceptance of the HMD based on non-ophthalmological reasons, for example, the weight of the unit or the length of the cable. However, for some specific working tasks, advantages in process optimisation and operator support were observed. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart."

Green was associated with the highest inside visual appeal and perceived quality of goods, which may be due to its intermediate wavelength. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2006.
"Matsumoto H.; Iida H.";0.0;The improvement of refractive function by oral intake of blackcurrant anthocyanins and its action mechanism;2007;Japanese Pharmacology and Therapeutics;0;Although it is well known that anthocyanins (ACs) have ophthalmic activity, little is known on the detailed pharmacological properties of different ACs. Delphinidin-3-rutinoside (D3R) is the major anthocyanin component isolated from blackcurrant fruits. The present experiments were designed to determine the mechanism of D3R (10-4M) relaxing effect on ciliary smooth muscle (CM). We found that D3R produced sustained and progressive relaxation during contraction induced by endothelin (ET)-1 (10-8M). A study on bovine ciliary muscle indicated D3R (10-4M) may stimulate ETB receptors localized in epithelium cells. It is possible this stimulation results in the production or release of NO and cyclic GMP that follows a reduction in the phosphorylation ratio of myosin light chain, thereby leading to relaxation of the CM. In a study on horse CM, D3R had a dose-dependent relaxing effect against ET-1 induced contraction. The critical concentration of this relaxing effect of D3R that was significantly different from controls was 10 -7M. This concentration is found in human ciliary muscle after oral intake of AC. Cyanidin-3-rutinoside (C3R) also had a significant relaxing effect at a concentration of 10-7M, although this effect was weaker than D3R. However, cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and delphinidin-3-glucoside (D3G) have no relaxing effect at a concentration of 10-7M. The effect of anthocyanins from either bilberry or blackcurrant on visual display terminal (VDT) task-induced refractive alteration was then examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in young healthy subjects (mean age 28.4 years). The VDT task was loaded for 2 hours and was performed between 2 to 4 hours post-administration. The subjects were given 40 mg of either anthocyanidin or placebo. In the blackcurrant anthocyanin (BCA) group, the variation in the refraction value of the dominant eye between baseline and 4 hours post-intake improved significantly compared to both the placebo and bilberry groups. This difference in efficacy may have been caused by variations in AC content, as BCA consists of D3R and C3R, whereas bilberry consists of the anthocyanin glucosides, D3G and C3G, and galactoside.

In the majority of published studies on this phenomenon, known as the Colavita effect, the auditory, visual, and bimodal stimuli have been presented in the ratio 40A:40V:20AV. In the present study, we investigated whether the relatively low frequency with which the bimodal targets in previous studies have been presented may have contributed to participants' difficulty in responding to such targets correctly. We manipulated the bimodal target probability by presenting the stimuli in the ratios 20A:20V:60AV, in Experiment 1; 5A:5V:90AV, 25A:25V:50AV, and 45A:45V:10AV, in Experiment 2. A significant Colavita visual dominance effect was observed when the bimodal targets were presented on 60% of the trials or less. We suggest that increasing the frequency of bimodal targets may have provided an exogenous cue to performance, that reduced the necessity for endogenous attention when selecting the appropriate response to make to bimodal targets. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A quantitative evaluation of the isometric force of the eye muscles in TAO might be useful in the detection of early stages of this disease. Methods: A total of 32 patients with TAO were divided into three groups according to whether they had mild active, pronounced, active, or longstanding, inactive disease. A group of six patients with Graves' disease without clinical signs of TAO and a group of 10 control subjects were also studied. The development of isometric force during saccadic eye movements of 5-, 10- and 20-degree amplitude in horizontal and vertical directions of gaze were recorded in the more affected eye in patients and the non-dominant eye in normal subjects, using a suction contact lens/strain gauge technique. Results: Peak tension (Fp) in vertical and horizontal saccadic movements was not significantly different between groups. Steady-state tension (Fs) was significantly higher in the groups with pronounced, active and longstanding, inactive disease than in the other groups for vertical (p < 0.01) and horizontal movements (p < 0.05). Abnormal force development in any of the gaze directions was seen in all patients with pronounced, active and longstanding, inactive TAO, and in some of the patients with mild, active TAO and Graves' disease without TAO. Conclusions: Increased eye muscle tension was recorded in different gaze directions, confirming multiple extraocular muscle involvement in TAO. It is suggested that the increased force development reflected contractile compensations for restrictions of ocular motility due to higher muscle stiffness in thyroid-associated eye muscle disease. Tension measurements can be used to identify muscle involvement in TAO. © 2007 Acta Ophthalmol Scand.
"Ehrenstein W.H.; Arnold-Schulz-Gahmen B.E.; Jaschinski W.";0.0;Eye preference within the context of binocular functions;2005;Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology;10.1007/s00417-005-1128-7;Background: Eye preference refers to an asymmetric use of the two eyes, but it does not imply a unitary asymmetry between the eyes. Many different methods are used to assess eye preference, including eyedness questionnaires and sighting tasks that require binocular and monocular alignment of a target through a hole in the middle of a card or funnel. The results of these coarse accounts of eye preference are useful as a first screening, but do not allow for graded quantification of the manifested asymmetry in binocular vision. Moreover, they often concern only a rather selective range of binocular functions. The aim of the present study was to further differentiate eye preference within the context of other binocular functions as measured in standard optometric tests, and to validate their relation to questionnaire data of eyedness. Methods: Conventional accounts of eye preference (German adaptation of Coren's questionnaire and a sighting task) were compared with various optometric tests of binocular function within a sample of 103 subjects. Examination included visual acuity and accommodation in each eye, stereoscopic prevalence, suppression due to binocular rivalry, fixation disparity (Mallett test). Results: Sighting dominance was leftward in 3 2% and rightward in 68% of the cases and was highly correlated (Kendall's τb=0.70) with eyedness. Further significant associations were restricted to stereoscopic prevalence which correlated with sighting dominance (τb=0.55), eyedness (τb=0.50), and rivalry dominance (τb=0.28). Conclusion: Eye preference seems to be essentially reflected by eyedness, sighting dominance, and stereoscopic prevalence, but largely unrelated to fixation disparity, accommodation, and visual acuity. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective consecutive case series analysis of children treated for amblyopia at a tertiary care center. All children received full time occlusion (FTO) for the dominant eye. Results: Eighty-eight children older than 6 years at the time of initiation of therapy were included. Age at initiation of therapy ranged from 6 to 20 years (9.45 ± 3.11 years). Forty-two children (47.7%) had strabismic amblyopia, 37 (42.0%) had anisometropic amblyopia and 9 (10.2%) had a combination of strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia. Eighty out of 88 eyes (90.0%) had improvement in visual acuity following FTO. Visual acuity (VA) improved from 0.82 ± 0.34 at presentation to 0.42 ± 0.34 (P < 0.001) after FTO. In children with strabismic amblyopia, VA improved from 0.81 ± 0.42 to 0.42 ± 0.39 (P < 0.001). In children with anisometropic amblyopia, visual acuity of the amblyopic eye improved from 0.82 ± 0.24 to 0.36 ± 0.29 (P < 0.001) following FTO. Out of 13 children older than 12 years, only 6 children (46.1%) had improvement in VA. Mean follow-up after complete stoppage of occlusion was 8.37 ± 1.78 months. Conclusion: Occlusion therapy yields favorable results in strabismic and/or anisometropic amblyopia, even when initiated for the first time after 6 years of age. After 12 years of age, some children may still respond to occlusion of the dominant eye.

Our aim was to examine the role of monocular and binocular vision in controlling posture in quiet stance. Methods: Twenty-eight normal subjects were tested. We used a force platform in measuring postural stability. In main experiment, postural stability was measured in four conditions: both eyes open (BEO), dominant eye open (DEO) non-dominant eye open (NDEO), and both eyes closed (BEC). In a further experiment, 11 subjects were tested in conditions where a vertical prism was placed in front of dominant eye. Prism was strong enough to cause diplopia. Our interest was to see, if diplopia affected the balance. Results: In main experiment, at level of group the body-sway in any of the three ocular (viewing) conditions did not differ from each other. At level of individuals, binocular vision was more effective on controlling posture in only half of subjects. In prism experiment, relative to normal binocular viewing the postural stability was modified in both prism conditions, but there was no difference between monocular and binocular viewing with prism. Conclusion: In quiet stance and in subjects with perfect binocular vision and stereopsis, the benefit out of binocular viewing in postural stability is subject-dependent. At the level of group, monocular vision provides equally good postural stability as binocular vision. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
Brooks K.R.;0.0;Monocular motion adaptation affects the perceived trajectory of stereomotion;2002;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance;10.1037/0096-1523.28.6.1470;Perceived stereomotion trajectory was measured before and after adaptation to lateral motion in the dominant or nondominant eye to assess the relative contributions of 2 cues: changing disparity and interocular velocity difference. Perceived speed for monocular lateral motion and perceived binocular visual direction (BVD) was also assessed. Unlike stereomotion trajectory perception, the BVD of static targets showed an ocular dominance bias, even without adaptation. Adaptation caused equivalent biases in perceived trajectory and monocular motion speed, without significantly affecting perceived BVD. Predictions from monocular motion data closely match trajectory perception data, unlike those from BVD sources. The results suggest that the interocular velocity differences make a significant contribution to stereomotion trajectory perception.

We ask whether the site of this integration is before or after the sites of binocular combination and disparity processing. Furthermore, we are interested in whether the efficiency with which local orientation information is integrated depends on the eye of origin. Our results suggest that orientation integration occurs after binocular integration but before disparity coding. We show that the effectiveness of added orientation noise is not only less than expected on signal or noise grounds but also that it depends on the dominance of the eye to which it is presented, suggesting an interocular opponent interaction in which the dominant eye input has higher gain. © 2005 Optical Society of America.

The dominance of a specific percept during rivalry can be affected by a surrounding stimulus. For example, if two discs containing bars with orthogonal orientations are both surrounded by an annulus containing bars with the same orientation as one of the two discs, the disc containing the bars orthogonal to the surround is more dominant (Fukuda & Blake, 1992). Here, we investigate whether this preference for a stimulus deviant from its surround can also be observed for moving stimuli. Stimuli: Two discs containing vertical sine-wave gratings, always moving horizontally in opposite direction, were presented dichoptically at the center of fixation. The discs could each be surrounded by an annulus containing a vertical sine-wave grating moving in the same direction as one of the two discs. The annulus was either presented to one eye [one-eye condition] or both eyes [two-eyes condition]. In the two-eyes condition, the annuli moved in the same direction. In the one-eye condition, the grating in the annulus moved in the same direction as the grating in the disc in the same eye, or in the same direction as the grating in the disc presented to the other eye. Observers had to continuously indicate the perceived direction of motion in the center disc. Results: For both conditions, the disc containing the grating with a direction of motion opposite to the surround was more dominant. Most interestingly, for the one-eye condition, the disc containing the grating moving in the direction opposite to the motion in the annulus was more dominant, irrespective of its positioning (same or different eye as compared to the annulus). Thus, also during binocular rivalry of moving stimuli, the grating in the disc moving in the deviant direction, as compared to the motion direction in the annuli, is preferred."
"Mapp A.P.; Ono H.; Barbeito R.";0.0;What does the dominant eye dominate? A brief and somewhat contentious review;2003;Perception and Psychophysics;10.3758/BF03194802;We examine a set of implicit and explicit claims about the concept of eye dominance that have been made over the years and note that the new literature on eye dominance does not reflect the old literature from the first half of the last century. We argue that the visual and oculomotor function of the dominant eye - defined by such criteria as asymmetry in acuity, rivalry, or sighting - remains unknown and that the usefulness of the concept for understanding its function is yet to be determined. We suggest that the sighting-dominant eye is the eye used for monocular tasks and has no unique functional role in vision.

The intraocular pressure of right- and left-eyes was higher in left-handers than right-handers. And there were significant negative correlations between hand preference and the intraocular pressure of both right- and left-eyes. We have concluded that the dominant eye has higher intraocular pressure compared to the nondominant one, and there is a relationship between hand preference and the intraocular pressure. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"van Dam L.C.J.; van Ee R.";0.0;Bistability in stereoscopically perceived slant about a horizontal axis;2003;Journal of Vision;10.1167/3.9.467;We exposed the visual system to an ambiguous 3D stimulus consisting of a grid for which monocular and binocular cues could specify different slants about a horizontal axis. Observers were asked to estimate the slant of the grid in 3D space. Monocular and binocular specified slants were varied independently across stimulus presentations. When monocular and binocular cues specified similar slants (no conflict) observers perceived a single orientation. However when the difference between the specified slants was large (cue-conflict), observers were able to select either a monocular or a binocular dominated percept. This result corroborates what van Ee, van Dam and Erkelens (Journal of Vision, 2002, 2, 597-607) reported for slants about a vertical axis. The slant estimates were described by a Bayesian model in which the different cues were implemented as different likelihoods. To describe the bifurcation in the data, two different modes were used in our model. One in which the monocular likelihood is dominant and the other in which the binocular likelihood is dominant. Further, observers were able to flip between percepts more or less at will, although spontaneous flips occurred frequently. Eye movement measurements revealed that (1) the flipping between percepts can occur under strict fixation and (2) when eye movements are allowed, there is no clear correlation between eye movements and perceptual flips: flips occur during long fixations as well as just after saccades or blinks. Therefore we suggest that perceptual flipping of the bistable grid stimulus is a central process in which eye movements are not necessarily involved.
"Jarrett D.; Ineson J.; Cheetham M.";0.0;Visual anomalies and display night vision goggles;2003;Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering;10.1117/12.484795;A brief study has been conducted to investigate several visual anomalies reported by test pilots using a Display Night Vision Goggle (DNVG) that superimposed symbols onto the intensified image seen by the right eye. A survey of relevant research suggests that one oddity, an apparent focus mis-match between the scene image and the injected symbols, is an irremovable facet of the perception of bright, contrasting, overlaid symbols. A second oddity, an uncomfortable and distracting blurring of the under-stimulated left eye during periods of flight in cloud, was eventually experienced by several people in a laboratory simulation, the effect being more noticeable if the under-stimulated eye was the dominant eye. A subsequent apparent enlargement of the HUD symbols and a post-flight focussing delay by the left eye seemed to be after-effects of whatever caused the ocular discomfort. As about 30% of the population are left eye dominant, the disturbing discomfort and aftermath could affect this proportion of pilots using a right-eye DNVG. Although further work is needed to understand the phenomena, it would be wise to warn aircrew and enable the symbol injection unit to be fitted to either channel of the DNVG.
"Crawford J.D.; Henriques D.Y.P.; Medendorp W.P.; Khan A.Z.";0.0;Ocular kinematics and eye-hand coordination;2003;Strabismus;10.1076/stra.11.1.33.14094;Eye-hand coordination is complicated by the fact that the eyes are constantly in motion relative to the head. This poses problems in interpreting the spatial information gathered from the retinas and using this to guide hand motion. In particular, eye-centered visual information must somehow be spatially updated across eye movements to be useful for future actions, and these representations must then be transformed into commands appropriate for arm motion. In this review, we present evidence that early visuomotor representations for arm movement are remapped relative to the gaze direction during each saccade. We find that this mechanism holds for targets in both far and near visual space. We then show how the brain incorporates the three-dimensional, rotary geometry of the eyes when interpreting retinal images and transforming these into commands for arm movement. Next, we explore the possibility that hand-eye alignment is optimized for the eye with the best field of view. Finally, we describe how head orientation influences the linkage between oculocentric visual frames and bodycentric motor frames. These findings are framed in terms of our 'conversion-on-demand' model, in which only those representations selected for action are put through the complex visuomotor transformations required for interaction with objects in personal space, thus providing a virtual on-line map of visuomotor space.

A half cusp sagittal relationship of the upper and lower M1 and Dm2 was determined on dental casts of 1423 young American black and white children in a cross-sectional sample with the mean age of 8.5 years (range 6-12 years). Hand, foot and eye preferences were recorded at the age of 4 years during the Collaborative Perinatal Study. The prevalences of symmetric bilateral Angle I and II and asymmetric unilateral Angle II right and Angle II left cases were compared between TRS and NRS children using Chi-square analysis. In general, unilateral Angle II right occurred in 9 per cent of the population and Angle II left in 6.5 per cent. In moderate non-right sideness (two-thirds of left dominant functions), these proportions were 17 and 3 per cent, respectively, and in true right sidedness 8 and 6 per cent, respectively. TRS subjects were more symmetric (bilateral Angle I or II in 85 per cent of cases) than NRS children (80 per cent), and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.02). These results highlight the anatomical relationships of structures supporting the occlusion and the symmetry/asymmetry of the neurocranium, cranial base, masticatory apparatus, and probably also the sidedness and the growth-stimulating effect of lateralized jaw function. Based on the results and considering earlier observations on brain asymmetry in functional lateralities, it can be hypothesized that a normal symmetric sagittal occlusal relationship is based on unilateral sagittal compensatory growth to maintain optimal bite, challenging early preventive orthodontic treatment in suspect unilateral Angle II cases. © European Orthodontic Society 2004; all rights reserved."

These data were added to a previously collected set of data with 40 right-handed participants in which unmatched stimulus pairs were used. Results showed that the expected right visual field advantage (RVFA) was significant in words but not in non-words. In addition, a significant practice effect was found to be larger for matched than unmatched stimulus pairs. The predicted interaction between stimulus type, stimulus pairing, and visual field was not significant; contrary to the initial hypothesis, the RVFA was larger (though not significantly so) for unmatched displays than for matched ones. Finally, the laterality effect was found to be more reliable with unmatched than matched pairs in non-words, whereas no difference was found in words. The discussion emphasises the advantages of unmatched stimulus pairs and the conditions under which the bilateral effect is likely to emerge."

Twenty right-handed and 10 left-handed participants performed the motor task, with 3 transfer trials following 3 practice trials. The author observed positive transfers from the left to the right hand for right-handers but the opposite direction of positive transfers for left-handers.

Two circles of same or different size were presented haploscopically in a binocular three-field tachistoscope, to right or left visual half-field and to the upper or lower visual field, one to the right eye and one to the left. A total of 43 subjects reported which of the two circles was the larger, each subject carrying out 120 trials of the experiment. Overall subjects reported that the stimulus to the left eye was significantly larger than that presented to the right eye. There was no association with eye dominance, and therefore the Coren and Porac finding could not be repeated. There was however a very significant association with handedness, left-handed subjects tending to report that the stimulus in the right eye looked larger, and right-handed subjects reporting that the stimulus in the left eye looked larger. © 2004 Psychology Press Ltd.

"He Z.J.; Ooi T.L.";0.0;Figural contours and border-ownership constraint in binocular rivalry;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.465;"Binocular rivalry is typically studied with a dichoptic stimulus whose half-images have similar figural contour (eg square frame) but different internal patterns (eg horizontal vs vertical lines). But given the importance of figural contours in defining the perceived binocular surface shape, one needs to examine how figural contours affect rivalry. To show that figural contours promote rivalry dominance, we used a large (10×10 deg) vertical grating surface as the binocular background. (i) Upon this a 1 deg circular horizontal grating patch (figural contour was added to one half-image. When this display was viewed, little rivalry was observed. Instead, a relatively stable horizontal patch was perceived against the larger vertical grating. (ii) But if a thin lined circle, or a circular illusory contour, was added to the other half-image corresponding to the circular patch, a vigorous rivalry ensued. Curiously, when (i) was repeated with a binocular background consisting of either a checkerboard or random dot texture with rich microstructure or local edge information, vigorous rivalry was observed. Thus, our findings suggest that monocular, real or illusory, figural contours can tilt the dominant rivalry percept, in favor of the image that owns the figural border. In a second experiment, we showed that such border-ownership constraint also applies to the typical rivalry stimulus. Capitalizing on the rivalry dominance-spreading observation (Blake et al, 1992; Wilson et al, 2001), we tested observers with a red horizontal grating (LE) and a green vertical grating (RE). A border-ownership constraint predicts that the small occlusion-valid areas at the figural contours of each half-image (LE: red at the right margin; RE: green at the left margin), as centers for dominance-spreading, will be more immune to rivalry suppression. Confirming this, our observers reported more dominance for the occlusion-valid areas for stimulus duration of 100 msec and longer."

However, this calibration method takes no account of the distance from the subject to the target. Version displacement of the pupil center was measured when the subject is fixating on stationary targets on the planes stood at different distances from the subject. As a result, the small transverse movement of the pupil center was observed when the subject had a version movement of the eyes for the targets on the near plane.

When observers were looking to the left, the left eye tended to dominate and when they were looking to the right, the right eye tended to dominate. The authors attributed the switch in eye dominance to extra-retinal signals associated with horizontal eye position. However, when one looks at a near object on the left, the image in the left eye is larger than the one in the right eye, and when one looks to the right, the opposite occurs. Thus, relative image size could also trigger switches in eye dominance. We used a cue-conflict paradigm to determine whether eye position or relative image size is the determinant of eye-dominance switches with changes in gaze angle. When eye position and relative image size were varied independently, there was no consistent effect of eye position. Relative image size appears to be the sole determinant of the switch. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Meng M.; Tong F.";0.0;Can attention selectively bias bistable perception? Differences between binocular rivalry and ambiguous figures;2004;Journal of Vision;10.1167/4.7.2;It is debated whether different forms of bistable perception result from common or separate neural mechanisms. Binocular rivalry involves perceptual alternations between competing monocular images, whereas ambiguous figures such as the Necker cube lead to alternations between two possible pictorial interpretations. Previous studies have shown that observers can voluntarily control the alternation rate of both rivalry and Necker cube reversal, perhaps suggesting that bistable perception results from a common mechanism of top-down selection. However, according to the biased competition model of selective attention, attention should be able to enhance the attended percept and suppress the unattended percept. Here, we investigated selective attentional modulation of dominance durations in bistable perception. Observers consistently showed much weaker selective attentional control for rivalry than for Necker cube reversal, even for rivalry displays that maximized the opportunities for feature-, object-, or space-based attentional selection. In contrast, nonselective control of alternation rate was comparably strong for both forms of bistable perception and corresponded poorly with estimates of selective attentional control. Our results support the notion that binocular rivalry involves a more automatic, stimulus-driven form of visual competition than Necker cube reversal, and as a consequence, is less easily biased by selective attention. © 2004 ARVO.
"Chen X.; He S.";0.0;Local factors determine the stabilization of monocular ambiguous and binocular rivalry stimuli;2004;Current Biology;10.1016/j.cub.2004.05.042;"Perceptual alternation in viewing bistable stimuli can be slowed or halted if the stimuli are presented intermittently [1, 2]. Memory of the recent perceptual experience has been proposed to explain this stabilization effect. But the nature of this ""perceptual memory"" remains unclear. By using a bistable rotating cylinder and two dichoptically presented orthogonal gratings, we explored the features that are important for the stabilization by changing a particular feature of the stimuli between alternate presentations. For the rotating cylinder, changing its color, rotating speed, size, or its stereo depth had no or minimal effect on the stabilization of its perceived rotation direction. For binocular rivalry, when the two gratings were matched in strength and then swapped between the two eyes synchronously with the intermittent presentation, the percepts were usually stabilized to one eye. In both cases, perceptual stabilization occurred only if the stimuli were presented to the same retinal location. These results suggest that the stabilization of monocular bistable stimuli is likely due to the removal of local adaptation, insensitive to the features that define the object identity. For binocular rivalry, preservation of the direction of interocular suppression rather than memory of the stimulus identity accounts for the stabilization effect."

"Hupé J.-M.; Rubin N.";0.0;Stimulus strength and dominance duration in perceptual bi-stability. Part II: From binocular rivalry to ambiguous motion displays;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.464;"In binocular rivalry, strengthening the stimulus to one eye does not affect the mean dominance duration of that eye, but instead decreases the dominance durations of the other eye (Levelt 1968). Here we show that this fundamental result can be generalized to another domain of perceptual bi-stability. Methods: Plaids made of rectangular-wave gratings were used. Plaids are bi-stable stimuli that can be seen as a single pattern moving coherently or two grating sliding over each other (transparency). We manipulated the strength of the transparent percept without affecting the coherent percept, relying on two facts: (i) during the transparency states, the sense of motion is dominated by the 'front' grating; (ii) there is a preference to see motion along cardinal directions (e.g. Andrews & Schluppeck VR 2000; Hupé & Rubin ARVO 2001). The plaids consisted of one cardinal and one oblique grating, with unambiguous depth ordering via occlusion cues. Shuffling the cardinal grating from back to front therefore enhanced the transparent percept, but did not affect the coherent percept (during coherency the two plaids looked indistinguishable). The mean duration of the transparency and coherency epochs were measured over 60 sec trials. Results: For all eight observers, strengthening the transparent percept led to a shortening of the mean duration of the coherency epochs, without affecting the duration of the transparency epochs, in analogy to Levelt's result. This suggests that there may be general rules governing the dynamics of bi-stable perception. Specifically, it suggests a suppressive/inhibitory coupling between rivaling stimulus interpretations as a general principle in the brain. Our results also suggest that measuring the mean durations of the coherency and transparency epochs may provide a way to asses whether a given manipulation affected motion integration or motion segmentation processes, or both. To date such independent assessment has not been possible."

These tests force subjects to decide in favour of one or the other eye. In contrast, ocular prevalence is determined using stereo-targets imaged within Panum's areas. These tests allow a graded quantification of the balance between the eyes. Here we present the computer-based Freiburg Ocular Prevalence Test in which stereo-disparate targets have to be aligned, and compare it with the Haase Stereo-balance Test that requires an estimation of the horizontal distance between stationary stereo-disparate objects. In addition, we compare ocular prevalence with ocular dominance. Methods: (1) We measured the influence of a neutral-grey filter in front of one eye to assess the suitability of the Freiburg and the Haase Tests in revealing graded amounts of ocular prevalence. (2) About 20 subjects with equal vision of their two eyes underwent the Freiburg and the Haase Tests for ocular prevalence, and Parson's Monoptoscope Test for ocular dominance. Results: (1) In both the Freiburg and the Haase Tests, the neutral-grey filter shifted ocular prevalence by about 50%. (2) An ocular prevalence of more than 10% occurred in 13 of the 20 subjects using the Freiburg, and in 14 using the Haase Test. On average, the ocular prevalence was 24.1±3.8% in the Freiburg and 32.0±8.2% in the Haase Test. The dominant eye coincided with the prevalent eye in 15 of the 20 subjects. Discussion: The effect of the neutral-grey filter indicated that both the Freiburg and the Haase Tests can be used to measure fractions of ocular prevalence, although the Freiburg Test carries a higher reproducibility. Spontaneous ocular prevalence occurs frequently in persons with equal vision of their two eyes. This suggests that ocular prevalence does not represent a condition that requires treatment. Rather, partial suppression of one eye, the correlate of ocular prevalence, may play a physiological role in that it helps to disregard double images at stereo-disparities close to the limits of Panum's area. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

When deletion involves its adjacent genes, i.e., those in the PAX6-WT1 critical region (WTCR), patients are predisposed to Wilms tumor. We studied 18 patients with aniridia, five of whom had chromosome deletion involving 11p13, two a translocation t(10;11)(p13;p13) or a der(14;21)(q10;q10)mat, and 11 had a normal karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using four P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) clones located at WTCR was carried out in the 18 patients to identify a deletion extent. Of the 18 patients, eight had a deletion of WTCR: four had microscopic deletion and four a deletion of WTCR. Deleted region in one patient with a microscopic deletion was distal to the critical region. Four of the eight patients with a deletion encompassing WTCR developed Wilms tumor, and the other four did not (two were too young to be evaluated for the tumor development). The data in the present study, together with four similar previous works, indicate that of a total of 102 aniridia patients, 29 had a deletion spanning WTCR.

"Carter O.L.; Campbell T.G.; Liu G.B.; Wallis G.";0.0;Contradictory influence of context on predominance during Binocular rivalry;2004;Clinical and Experimental Optometry;10.1111/j.1444-0938.2004.tb03168.x;Background: Binocular rivalry is a complex process characterised by alternations in perceptual suppression and dominance that result when two different images are presented simultaneously to the left and right eyes. It has been reported recently that the addition of contextual cues will promote the predominance of the context consistent rivalry target. In contrast to Levelt's second proposition (1965), this effect has been found to result exclusively from an increase in the dominance phase duration, while the suppression phase duration remains unaffected. Methods: Human subjects were simultaneously presented with a small (2°) disc consisting of gratings (four cycles per degree) of different orientations to the two eyes. Four experiments were conducted to ascertain the effects of background gratings and contextual colour information on target predominance and phase duration. For each of the four experimental conditions, the orientation and colour of the target gratings and surrounding contextual background were systematically manipulated. Results: In this study, we report an effect opposite to that of Levelt. Contradictory contextual information increases target predominance and phase duration during binocular rivalry. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to promote the dominance of the context contradictory percept with co-linearity, co-chromaticity and orientation cues. In line with previous studies involving context, we find that this effect on predominance is due to an increase in the duration of the dominance rather than the suppression phase. Discussion: We discuss our findings in respect to those from previous studies and consider high-and low-level processes that may be responsible for these apparently 'contradictory' roles of context on binocular rivalry. In addition, we discuss how the apparent 'anti-Levelt' effect of context can be reinterpreted in a manner that brings it back in line with Levelt's second proposition and raises the question of whether 'suppressability' plays a disproportionately large role in determining the duration of perceptual phases in binocular rivalry.

Selected comparisons with normal populations;2004;Psychiatry Research;10.1016/j.psychres.2003.12.018;The aim of this study was to investigate lateral bias in patients with early-onset schizophrenia. Hand, eye, and foot preferences and relative hand skill were examined in early-onset patients (n=44) and matched controls (n=39), and were compared with population estimates. Patients demonstrated a significant excess in mixed handedness (20.5% vs. 8.5%) relative to population estimates and reduced relative hand skill on a pegboard task compared with controls. Left eye preference was significantly less common in schizophrenic patients relative to population estimates. Crossed eye-hand and eye-foot preferences were not significantly increased in the patient group as a whole but were present, respectively, in four of nine and five of nine mixed-handed patients but in none of five mixed-handed controls. These findings are consistent with the view that lateralisation is anomalous in schizophrenia early in the course of illness. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Hayami T.; Shidoji K.; Matsunaga K.; Horimoto S.; Matsugashita H.";0.0;Measuring visual axis as an independent variable from a fixation distance;2002;Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics;0;Our pilot study suggested that while fixating on a stationary object binocularly, each line of sight of the two eyes does not always go directly toward the object. Therefore, we experimentally investigated the amount the displacement of the pupil center while fixation point was changed transversally. The subjects were instructed to fixate on three targets arranged horizontally with intervals of nine degrees. The distance from the subject to the targets was any of 0.5 m, 1.0 m and 1.5 m. A significant difference of the amount of the displacement of the pupil center was observed relative to the fixation distance. The positions of the node of the line of sight, which provide no relationship between the fixation distance and the pupil center displacement, were calculated. The node of the line of sight of the non-dominant eye was nearer to the fixation panels than that of the dominant eye. Considering this, such a node would be effective for the precise measurement of gazing point.

Examining multistable binocular rivalry (involving four dominant percepts), we demonstrated path dependence and on-line adaptation, which were equivalent whether perceived patterns were formed by single-eye dominance or by mixed-eye dominance. The spontaneous perceptual transitions tended to get trapped within a pair of related global patterns (e.g., opponent shapes and symmetric patterns), and during such trapping, the probability of returning to the repeatedly experienced patterns gradually decreased (postselection pattern adaptation). These results suggest that the structure of global shape coding and its adaptation play a critical role in directing spontaneous alternations of visual awareness in perceptual multistability."

The shifting distance of the right-eve was marginally greater, although significant, in the left-handers as compared to the right-handers. The shifting distance of the left-eye was greater in the right-handers than in the left-handers. The distance of focusing points of two eyes in the horizontal plane was greater in the right-handers than in the left-handers. In the total sample, there was a significant negative Pearson correlation between hand-preference and the shifting distance of the right-eye, and there was a positive correlation between hand-preference and the shifting distance of the left-eye. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between hand preference and the distance of focusing points of two eyes. These results suggest that hand preference may be related to the degree of ocular asymmetry.

To investigate the relation between sighting and sensory eye dominance and attempt to quantitatively examine eye dominance using a balance technique based on binocular rivalry. Methods. The durations of exclusive visibility of the dominant and nondominant eye target in binocular rivalry were measured in 14 subjects. The dominant eye was determined by using the hole-in-card test (sighting dominance). In study 1, contrast of the target in one eye was fixed at 100% and contrast of the target in the other eye was varied from 100% to 80% to 60% to 40% to 20%, when using rectangular gratings of 1, 2, and 4 cycles per degree (cpd) at 2°, 4°, and 8° in size. In study 2, contrast of the target in the nondominant eye was fixed at 100% and contrast of the target in the dominant eye was varied from 100% to 80% to 60% to 40% to 20%, when using a rectangular grating of 2 cpd at 4° in size. Results. In study 1, the total duration of exclusive visibilities of the dominant eye target; that is, the target seen by the eye that had sighting dominance was longer compared with that of the nondominant eye target. When using rectangular gratings of 4 cpd, mean total duration of exclusive visibility of the dominant eye target was statistically longer than that of the nondominant eye target (p < 0.05). In study 2, reversals (in which duration of exclusive visibility of the nondominant eye becomes longer than the dominant eye when the contrast of the dominant eye target is decreased) were observed for all contrasts except for 100%. Conclusions. The dominant sighting eye identified by the hole-in-card test coincided with the dominant eye as determined by binocular rivalry. The contrast at which reversal occurs indicates the balance point of dominance and seems to be a useful quantitative indicator of eye dominance to clinical applications."
Gilmore R.O.;0.0;Do enriched visual displays improve infants' discrimination of optic flow patterns simulating self-motion?;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.505;Both a looking time habituation and a modified forced-choice preferential looking (FPL) technique indicate that infants younger than six months of age discriminate optic flow patterns that simulate only large (>20°) changes in the direction of observer-motion along a simulated ground plane. Two experiments were conducted to examine whether infants' sensitivity differs under display conditions where information about heading direction and motion in depth is enriched. In Experiment 1, 3-, 4-, and 5-month-old infants were tested using FPL to measure discrimination between optic flow displays that simulated translation at 5 m/s along different trajectories of motion (12-90°) through a cloud-like pattern of random dots that filled two 15° (H) by 30° (V) regions at the 90 cm viewing distance. In Experiment 2, 3- to 6-month-olds were tested using similar techniques but with visually rich displays generated using a 3D animation rendering system. The displays incorporated visual cues to depth and direction change such as optic expansion, texture gradients, horizon cues, accretion and deletion of contours, and motion parallax. The data from both studies confirm the previous findings that heading direction discrimination thresholds are large (20-70°) in young infants and decline only modestly with increasing age. Enriched visual displays do not result in substantially lower discrimination thresholds relative to previous reports of responses toward ground plane patterns. Consequently, the relatively poor discrimination abilities found previously appear not to be due to specific display-related factors, but instead may reflect a diminished sensitivity to changes in the direction of self-motion that are specified by visual information.
"Lee S.-H.; Blake R.";0.0;A fresh look at interocular grouping during binocular rivalry;2004;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2003.12.007;"During binocular rivalry, observers sometimes perceive one complete visual object even though component features of that perceptually dominant object are distributed between the two eyes and are in rivalry against other, dissimilar features. This interocular grouping cannot be explained by models of rivalry in which one eye or the other is completely dominant at any given moment. But perhaps global interocular grouping is achieved by simultaneous local eye dominance, wherein portions of one eye's view and complementary portions of the other eye's view become dominant simultaneously. To test this possibility, we performed two experiments using relatively large, complex figures as rival targets. In one experiment we used an ""eye-swap"" technique to confirm that within given, local spatial regions of rivalry it was the region of an eye - not a given stimulus feature - that was usually dominant. In a second experiment, we measured dominance durations for multiple, local zones of rivalry and then created 1-min animations of a global ""montage"" in which dominance within local regions was governed by the distributions of dominance measured empirically. These animations included significant periods of time during which global interocular grouping was evident; observers viewed these animations intermixed with actual rivalry displays, and the resulting tracking data confirmed the similarity in global dominance of the two display types. Thus interocular grouping during rivalry does not rule out local, eye-based rivalry, although synergistic and top-down influences almost certainly provide additional force in the promotion of interocular grouping. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Koivisto M.; Revonsuo A.";0.0;Preconscious analysis of global structure: Evidence from masked priming;2004;Visual Cognition;10.1080/13506280344000266;According to the global precedence hypothesis, the perceptual processing of complex objects proceeds from global structure to the analysis of local elements. In the present study, we used a masked priming paradigm to explore whether the global or the local level of hierarchical letters is analysed at preconscious processing stages. Experiment 1 found masked priming only after global prime letters in focused-attention conditions. Experiment 2 used a divided-attention task in which attention was not focused specifically on either level of hierarchy and did not find any priming. Experiment 3 used otherwise the same task as Experiment 2 but biased attention either to the global or the local level by manipulating the probability that targets appeared at one level. Priming was found after global prime letters in the global-bias condition but not in the local-bias condition. Experiments 4a and 4b suggest that the size of the local letters was not responsible for the lack of priming after local primes. The results suggest a priority for global processing already at a preconscious level and that attentional factors may modulate processes at this level.
Feldman J.;0.0;What is a visual object?;2003;Trends in Cognitive Sciences;10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00111-6;The concept of an 'object' plays a central role in cognitive science, particularly in vision, reasoning and conceptual development - but it has rarely been given a concrete formal definition. Here I argue that visual objects cannot be defined according to simple physical properties but can instead be understood in terms of the hierarchical organization of visual scene interpretations. Within the tree describing such a hierarchical description, certain nodes make natural candidates as the 'joints' between objects, representing division points between parts of the image that cohere internally but do not perceptually group with one another. Thus each subtree hanging from such a node corresponds to a single perceived 'object'. This formal definition accords with several intuitions about the way objects behave.

We investigated this by asking eight subjects with normal vision to read isolated letters, words and text passages while an artificial scotoma covered a central portion of the visual field. We quantified viewing strategy and analysed changes in their viewing behaviour over 8â€""10 sessions within a two-week period. Subjects read while either a horizontal (n = 4) or vertical bar scotoma (n = 4), 10Â° wide, covered the entire horizontal or vertical meridian of the stimulus field.For the horizontal scotoma group: (1) there was an increasing preference to use the inferior visual field for isolated letters/words and text passages, which was essentially complete within the test period; (2) the superior visual field was preferred when reading letters/words initially presented in upper visual space and the inferior visual field when reading letters/words initially presented in lower visual space; (3) in general, variation in viewing strategy according to stimulus position diminished over the sessions for all stimuli.For the vertical scotoma group: (1) two subjects used the left and right visual fields in approximately equal proportion to view isolated letters/words, one subject showed a weak preference to use the left visual field and one subject developed a strong preference for using the right visual field; (2) the text passages could be read with combined use of left and right visual fields in a specific manner; (3) the left visual field was preferred to view stimuli initially presented in left visual space while the right visual field was preferred for words initially presented in right visual space. This effect diminished across sessions.Overall, these findings indicate that (1) a specific viewing strategy can be developed through as little as 5 hours of reading experience without guided training; (2) two distinctly separate retinal areas can be used in an integrated manner during reading; (4) stimulus position in visual space can influence viewing strategy; (5) in general, reading encourages a preference for the inferior over the superior visual field, but not the left over right visual field. Letter/word/text recognition and reading speeds increased progressively across sessions, even after scotoma lateralisation appeared stabilised suggesting that multiple mechanism are involved in adaptive changes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Mansouri B.; Hess R.F.; Allen H.A.; Sebbag S.; Dakin S.C.";0.0;The site of orientation integration;2003;Journal of Vision;10.1167/3.9.456;Purpose. We wanted to know if the site of orientation integration (Dakin, JOSA 2001) was at an early or late stage in the visual pathway relative to the site of binocular integration. Methods. We used a task in which subjects had to judge the mean orientation of an array of oriented Gabors. The Gabor orientations were samples from a Gaussian orientation distribution of variable bandwidth and mean that was left or right of vertical. The internal noise and number of samples were estimated from fitting a standard summation-variance model to the data. These orientation samples were either presented to one eye or to both eyes under dichoptic viewing. When presented to both eyes they could be in the same disparity plane or in different disparity planes. In some cases, signals of random orientation (termed noise) were added to the signal orientations in one or other of the above conditions. Results. Performance on this task depended on whether the signal and noise were presented in different disparity planes. Furthermore similar results were obtained for dichoptic and monoptic viewing conditions. Interestingly, noise significantly (p<0.05) disrupts performance when it is presented to the dominant eye, leading to higher thresholds, higher internal noise, and decreased sampling efficiency. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the site of orientation integration is not only after the site of binocular integration but also after the site where disparity is encoded. The finding that the effectiveness of noise depends on the eye to which it is presented, even though this information is not known to the subject, suggests that there are also monocular pathways through which this type of integration can occur although their sensitivity must be reduced compared with their binocular counterpart.
Yoshida S.;0.0;Extracellular environment and extracellular serine proteases in the central nervous system;2003;Connective Tissue;0;Extracellular serine proteases play important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) by modifying extracellular environments. Prothrombin is expressed in the CNS and thrombin has been shown to have inhibitory function on neurite extension, however, its physiological function is not fully understood. Tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) has important function on neural plasticity in ocular dominance and long-term potentiation (LTP). tPA also has crucial function in the excitotoxic neuronal cell death through the activation of plasminogen. Beyond these proteases, several kallikrein family proteases including neuropsin and protease M are expressed in the CNS. Neuropsin is mainly expressed in the neurons of the limbic system and has important in the neural plasticity such as LTP and kindling. Following injury, neuropsin is induced in oligodendrocytes and may be related to demyelination. Protease M is constitutively expressed in oligodendrocytes and may have scavenging function. Other kallikrein family proteases are expressed in the CNS but their functions remained to be clarified.

All these different sources of information have to be efficiently merged to form a coherent and robust percept. Here we highlight some of the mechanisms that underlie this merging of the senses in the brain. We show that, depending on the type of information, different combination and integration strategies are used and that prior knowledge is often required for interpreting the sensory signals.

This relationship is observed in a variety of tasks, including aesthetic judgment of paintings, spotting differences between two paintings, and visual search for a tilted line among similarly tilted distractors. This article does not provide an explanation of the relationship between this asymmetry and gender but rules out several potential mediating factors, such as eye dominance, head tilt, handedness, and hemispheric differences. At the same time, the scope of the phenomenon is outlined: The asymmetry is found for both meaningful and meaningless stimuli and in both brief and extended presentations. Moreover, the asymmetry is found to be related to the tilt of the visual elements that require processing, not to their location in the visual field. Copyright 2004 Psychonomic Society, Inc.
"Andrews T.J.; Blakemore C.";0.0;Integration of motion information during binocular rivalry;2002;Vision Research;10.1016/S0042-6989(01)00286-3;When two moving gratings are superimposed in normal viewing they often combine to form a pattern that moves with a single direction of motion. Here, we investigated whether the same mechanism underlies pattern motion when drifting gratings are presented independently to the two eyes. We report that, with relatively large circular grating patches (4 deg), there are periods of monocular dominance in which one eye's orientation alone is perceived, usually moving orthogonal to the contours (component motion). But, during the transitions from one monocular view to the other, a fluid mosaic is perceived, consisting of contiguous patches, each containing contours of only one of the gratings. This entire mosaic often appears to move in a single direction (pattern motion), just as when two gratings are literally superimposed. Although this implies that motion signals from the perceptually suppressed grating continue to influence the perception of motion, an alternative possibility is that it reflects a strategy that involves integrating directional information from the contiguous single-grating patches. To test between these possibilities, we performed a second experiment with very small grating stimuli that were about the same size as the contiguous single-grating patches in the mosaic (1-deg diameter). Despite the fact that the form of only one grating was perceived, we report that pattern motion was still perceived on about one third of trials. Moreover, a decrease in the occurrence of pattern motion was apparent when the contrast and spatial frequency of the gratings were made more different from each other. This phenomenon clearly demonstrates an independent binocular interaction for form and motion. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Graphic displays were used to identify changes in looking throughout the task. Many infants exhibited strong side biases produced by infants looking repeatedly in the same direction. Although an overall novelty preference was found for the group, individual infants exhibited brief novelty runs. Few infants began with a familiarity preference. We argue that variable looking patterns emerged during the task from competition between the infants' preference to look for something novel versus their tendency to look back to previous locations. Our data suggest that looking during paired-comparison tasks is a dynamic process dependent on perceptual-motor events happening during the task itself.

Instead, they may segment and recognize these objects in a piecemeal way. Here we test whether observers can use the appearance of one object part to predict the location and appearance of other object parts. During several training sessions, observers studied an object against a blank background. They then viewed this object against a background of clutter that camouflaged some parts of the object while leaving other parts salient. The observer's task was to find the camouflaged part. We varied the symmetry of the salient part with the expectation that as this symmetry decreased, the information about the camouflaged part's location and appearance would increase and this would facilitate search. Our results suggest that observers can use the salient part to predict the location, but not the appearance, of the camouflaged part. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Experiment 1, 4-month-old infants responded to the exclusive distinction of dogs or cats when tested in a paired-comparison task. In Experiments 2 and 3, 6-month-old infants, but not 4-month-old infants, responded to this same distinction in a successive presentation task, even when the amount of familiarization was equated to that of the paired comparison task. Therefore, familiarization with a particular set of stimuli does not induce infants to respond to a single category but rather they respond to different categories depending on features of the task.

Following Csibra, Biro, Koos, and Gergely (2003), infants were habituated to a simple chasing event involving animated balls, and at test saw 2 possible endings: either 1 ball caught the other or failed to do so. Two controls were added to the previous work. First, the total amount of motion was controlled in the test endings; second, the endings were paired with a nonchasing beginning to ensure that behavior at test reflected representation of the event beginning itself. The results replicated Csibra et al.'s finding that infants look longer at the noncatching ending following the chasing beginning; moreover, infants showed no preference for either ending following the no-chasing beginning. This study supports the claim that infants can calculate the rational ending of a goal-directed motion event. Copyright © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc."
"Wong E.H.; Levi D.M.; Barrett B.T.; Pacey I.";0.0;Non-linear transformation of sinusoidal gratings in amblyopia;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.135;Purpose: Both amblyopic and fellow non-amblyopic eyes show reduced sensitivity for static second-order stimuli (contrast modulation (envelope) of a sinusoidal grating (carrier)) (Wong, Levi & McGraw, 2001). In the present study we investigated whether that result was confounded by amblyopes having an abnormal early non-linearity to luminance. That is, an abnormal non-linearity to sinusoidal gratings could produce luminance artifacts at the envelope spatial frequency that might be detected in addition to the second-order (non-luminance defined) structure. MethodsS: We investigated this by having amblyopic and normal adult subjects view sinusoidal gratings (prior study carriers, contrast 5 - 90%) in which we varied the width of light and dark bars, with the provision that mean luminance was maintained. We psychophysically determined the point of subjective equality between light and dark bars for each eye of the amblyopes and the dominant eye of the control subjects. Results: All eyes perceived light bars to be wider than dark bars when bars were of equal width. This perception occurred for all sinusoidal gratings and corresponded to a non-linearity that weights luminance decrements more than luminance increments by a factor of 1.01 - 1.21. The weighting factors for both amblyopic and non-amblyopic eyes were not larger than that for the control eyes. Therefore, with respect to transformation of luminance, the second-order filter stage in amblyopia appears to receive normal first-order input. Conclusions: We conclude that the loss of second-order sensitivity in our prior study was not confounded by amblyopes perception of a luminance (first-order) artifact at the envelope spatial frequency.

They were asked to make saccades of 7.5° and 15° along the horizontal and vertical principal meridians and horizontal saccades between secondary and tertiary positions in the upper and lower field. Five subjects performed the experiment with a 2% overall reduction lens inserted over their dominant eye; three subjects participated in a second experiment with an overall magnification lens of 2% also inserted in front of the dominant eye. The results showed a persistent decrease or increase in the size of the saccade of the dominant eye that was subject dependent for horizontal saccades, but consistent over subjects for vertical saccades. Persistent disconjugacy, at least for vertical saccades, is interpreted as evidence of learning."
"Otakeno S.; Matthews R.S.J.; Folio L.; Previc F.H.; Lessard C.S.";0.0;The effects of visual scenes on roll and pitch thresholds in pilots versus nonpilots;2002;Aviation Space and Environmental Medicine;0;"Background: Previous studies have indicated that, compared with nonpilots, pilots rely more on vision than ""seat-of-the-pants"" sensations when presented with visual-vestibular conflict. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether pilots and nonpilots differ in their thresholds for tilt perception while viewing visual scenes depicting simulated flight. Methods: This study was conducted in the Advanced Spatial Disorientation Demonstrator (ASDD) at Brooks AFB, TX. There were 14 subjects (7 pilots and 7 nonpilots) who recorded tilt detection thresholds in pitch and roll while exposed to sub-threshold movement in each axis. During each test run, subjects were presented with computer-generated visual scenes depicting accelerating forward flight by day or night, and a blank (control) condition. Results: The only significant effect detected by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was that all subjects were more sensitive to tilt in roll than in pitch [F (2,24) = 18.96, p < 0.001]. Overall, pilots had marginally higher tilt detection thresholds compared with nonpilots (p = 0.055), but the type of visual scene had no significant effect on thresholds. Conclusion: In this study, pilots did not demonstrate greater visual dominance over vestibular and proprioceptive cues than nonpilots, but appeared to have higher pitch and roll thresholds overall. The finding of significantly lower detection thresholds in the roll axis vs. the pitch axis was an incidental finding for both subject groups."

Published results are mixed with regards to our ability to detect symmetry rotated in depth. We investigated the role of depth cues on the detection of symmetry for patterns rotated in depth. Methods: Dot patterns (24 light grey dots on a black background) 1° in diameter were presented at the center of a CRT screen. Vertical, Horizontal, 45°, and 135° orientations of symmetry were presented in separate blocks of trials. Symmetry detection was tested for 7 different rotations of the CRT screen spanning ±75° relative to the observer. Each depth rotation was tested in a separate block of trials. Subjects were tested monocularly using their dominant eye. In FULL VIEWING the room was illuminated, and the subject could see the CRT screen and all other surfaces that could provide monocular depth cues. In the NO DEPTH CUES condition, the room lights were off, and the central region of the CRT was viewed through a tube which prevented subjects from seeing anything but the dot patterns. The accuracy and reaction time for detecting symmetry and asymmetry were recorded. Results: Asymmetric patterns viewed through the tube appeared to float in space at an indeterminate distance from the subject. Subjects were unable to correctly determine the screen rotation when looking through the tube. For FULL VIEWING, the speed and accuracy (>90%) of symmetry detection were similar for depth rotations between ±60°. At the ±75° rotations, symmetry detection was slower and less accurate for all symmetry orientations, with a larger effect for oblique symmetry. Testing in the NO DEPTH CUES condition extended the disruption of symmetry detection to the ±60° depth rotations. Conclusions: We found that symmetry could be detected despite large rotations in depth. Although restricting depth cues made symmetry detection more difficult, the effect was not to the degree reported in other studies.

A total of 55 males and 170 females were tested for laterality preferences and spatial test performance using a range of six spatial tests. There was a statistically significant relationship between each of the laterality measures employed, with handedness and footedness demonstrating the most robust association. Multiple regression analyses highlighted that once potential confounds were statistically controlled (age, sex, and other types of functional laterality), 3-D rotation/visualisation and speeded visual exploration task performance showed small, but significant, relations with a tendency towards left-handedness over right-handedness in total and secondary (two-handed) scale scores. Flexibility of closure performance was associated with a tendency towards left-handedness in the total and one-handed scale scores. Spatial location memory was the lone spatial ability relating with a tendency towards right-handedness. Overall, these findings offer new insights into the interplay of handedness with alternative measures of laterality as well as with spatial abilities. © 2004 Psychology Press Ltd.
"Quartley J.; Firth A.Y.";0.0;Binocular Sighting Ocular Dominance Changes with Different Angles of Horizontal Gaze;2004;Binocular Vision and Strabismus Quarterly;0;"Background and Purpose: Ocular dominance testing is generally carried out in the primary position. A change of eye dominance when viewing in the contralateral field of horizontal gaze has recently been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this occurs with other tests of eye dominance. Methods: Ten right handed females (mean age 21.6 +/-0.8 years) with normal binocular single vision and right eye ocular dominance in primary position were tested for ocular dominance on three tests (pointing, hole-in-card, Miles ABC) performed fixing at positions at 10 degree intervals from 40 degrees left gaze to 40 degrees right gaze, with the head stationary. Four trials were undertaken in each position for each test. Results: Not all participants showed a change in dominance in left gaze on all of the tests. However, a change did occur at a median of 30 degrees for the hole-in-card and Miles ABC tests and 20 degrees for the pointing test. Examining the position of change across the 3 tests, a borderline ""statistically significant"" difference occurred (p=0.055, Friedman test). A ""statistically significant"" difference was shown between the hole-in-card and pointing tests (p=0.041, Wilcoxon signed ranks test). For pointing versus Miles ABC, p=0.084; and hole-in-card versus Miles ABC, p=0.705. Conclusions: A change in eye dominance occurs when viewing in the contralateral field. Differences may exist in the angle at which this occurs due to the different conditions of the various tests for ocular dominance."

Hand preference was assessed by the modified version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Ocular dominance was measured by means of the near-far alignment test. Migraine diagnoses were made on the basis of criteria provided from the International Headache Society. In the overall sample and in women, left-handedness and left-eyedness were not significantly correlated with migraine. In men, the incidence of left-handedness and left-eyedness were significantly higher in patients than in controls. The presence of aura in patients with migraine was significantly associated with the incidence of left-eyedness and crossed hand-eye dominance, but not handedness, for the total sample and women. These results suggest that there may be a tendency towards anomalous dominance, especially left-eyedness, in migraine patients particularly those with aura. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2005.
"Pearson J.; Clifford C.W.G.";0.0;Determinants of visual awareness following interruptions during rivalry;2004;Journal of Vision;10.1167/4.3.6;The inability of the human visual system to fuse dissimilar patterns in corresponding regions of the two eyes results in stochastic alternation of perceptual dominance between the two patterns: rivalry. When rivalrous stimuli are presented intermittently their perception is stabilized (Leopold, Wilke, Maier, & Logothetis, 2002). This stability indicates the operation of some kind of perceptual memory across interruptions in stimulation. Here we examined the contents of this perceptual memory to quantify the relative contributions of different sources of information: eye-of-origin, orientation, and color. Stimuli were intermittently presented and, during each blank interruption, we swapped either the color, orientation, or eye of presentation of the gratings. Comparing the percepts reported before and after each interruption allowed us to establish what aspects of perception remained stable. During conventional binocular rivalry, the eye in which the stimulus was presented remained stable across 74% of interruptions. Stimulus color and orientation also had weaker significant effects. When eye-of-origin information was eliminated by alternating the patterns rapidly between the two eyes, stimulus color remained stable across 86% of interruptions. Stimulus orientation again had a weaker but significant effect. These results demonstrate that the mechanisms mediating perceptual stability across interruptions in rivalry can operate at both monocular and binocular levels, much like the mechanisms operating during continuous viewing of rivalrous stimuli. On the basis of this similarity, we speculate that perceptual memory across interruptions in rivalry may involve the same neural representations as visual competition during rivalry. If this is the case, the use of intermittent stimulation in rivalry might permit the investigation of aspects of the mechanisms underlying visual competition that remain hidden during continuous presentation. © 2004 ARVO.

Methods: Magnified reading aid was purchased by 29 persons out of a series of 92 patients seen at our low-vision clinic during the past 16 months. They were interviewed over the telephone. Results: Twenty-eight persons responded to the questionnaire. The reading aid was actually used by 24 persons (86%). They comprised 17 males and 7 females. Their ages ranged from 42 to 92 years, average 69 years. The visual acuity in the dominant eye ranged from 0.02 to 0.5. Twenty persons (84%) preferred color function to monochromatic one. Visual impairment was due to macular degeneration (29%), diabetic retinopathy (21%), glaucoma (21%) and others. Conclusion: Reading aid utilizing closed-circuit television improves the quality of life of visually handicapped persons. Follow-up assistance is keenly needed.

According to the Superposition Hypothesis, this blending is replaced by binocular rivalry after the emergence of stereopsis [Neonate Cognition: Beyond the Blooming, Buzzing Confusion, Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ, 1985, p. 37; Early Visual Development Normal and Abnormal, Oxford University Press, New York, 1993, p. 201]. The main evidence for the Superposition Hypothesis is a preferential looking experiment [Vision Res., 26 (3) (1986) 501], in which 8-12-week-old infants fixated a rivalrous (for adults) dichoptic plaid, in preference over a fusible grating of parallel lines. This report describes our attempt to repeat that important experiment. Infant stereopsis emerged at 8.6 weeks under our conditions, but infants did not preferentially fixate the dichoptic plaid at any age between age 5 and 16 weeks. Control experiments showed that our result was not due to technical differences between their experiment and ours (red/green vs. polarizing glasses, the use of a fixation point, or the infant observation apparatus). Therefore, blending of the visual responses to rivalrous (for adults) stimuli is not a general feature of the pre-stereoptic infant visual system. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Ooi T.L.; He Z.";0.0;On the initiation and spreading of interocular suppression from binocular vertical contours;2003;Journal of Vision;10.1167/3.9.452;"Here we further our finding (He & Ooi, VSS02) that binocular figural contours (frames surrounding a rivalry stimulus) instigate binocular rivalry. Specifically, the dominant features in the rivalry zones neighboring the binocular vertical contours are features carried by the implicit half-occluded zones. Once triggered, these features spread their dominance to the remaining rivalry stimulus leading to suppression of features in the corresponding implicit non-half-occluded zones. In Test 1, red (RE) and green (LE) horizontal rectangles (2.77× 0.57 deg) were shown on a white background, followed 0.5-1 sec later, by a binocular black vertical bar (0.29×1.64 deg). Observers saw red to the right of the vertical bar and green to the left, confirming that dominance is triggered from the implicit half-occluded zones. In Test 2, observers tracked their rivalry percept in two displays: (i) both eyes saw a large vertical grating (4.7cpd) background while only one eye saw a circular patch of horizontal grating (target,0.98 deg); (ii) the orientations of the background and target gratings in display (i) were rotated 90 deg. Higher predominance for the target was found in display (ii) with horizontal background, underscoring the propensity of binocular vertical contours to trigger rivalry in (i). Test 3 extended the observation by Shimojo & Nakayama (1990). Binocular vertical bars were placed on a larger binocular background of horizontal grating. In one eye, solid rectangles were placed adjacent to and straddling the vertical bar. As predicted, the rectangle in the implicit half-occluded zone remained dominant, while the other rectangle tended to be suppressed by the background grating. Of interest, the suppression began at the zone adjacent to the vertical bar and spread to the remaining area of the 4rectangle. Altogether, our findings suggest that rivalry initiation and spreading operate at the level where half-occlusion is registered by the eye-of-origin signal."
"Ghose T.; Banks M.S.; Hillis J.M.";0.0;Eye dominance changes with eye position and image magnification;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.326;Eye dominance switches depending on whether the observer is looking left or right (Khan & Crawford, 2001). It is not known whether the switch is caused by a change in the eyes' positions, by a change in relative image magnification, or by both. We investigated the cause of dominance switch by independently manipulating eye position and image magnification. The stimuli were presented in a custom haploscope. A small target was presented in the center of a square. The target had zero disparity and the square had crossed disparity. Eye position was manipulated by rotating the arms of the haploscope so that the observer had to turn the eyes to look at the stimuli. Relative image magnification was manipulated by calculating the magnification associated with a variety of azimuths and applying them to the dichoptic square. On each trial, observers indicated whether the target appeared displaced leftward or rightward from the center of the square. If the left eye was dominant, the target would appear displaced to the left. If the right eye was dominant, it would be displaced rightward. The results showed, in agreement with Khan and Crawford, that the left eye was more dominant when the eyes were turned leftward and the right eye more dominant when they were turned rightward. The results also showed that relative image magnification affected dominance. For example, when the eyes were turned rightward, but the image was larger in the left eye, dominance shifted toward the left eye. We conclude that the shift in eye dominance that occurs with viewing direction is caused by both eye position and relative image magnification.
"Watson T.L.; Pearson J.; Clifford C.W.G.";0.0;Perceptual grouping of biological motion promotes binocular rivalry;2004;Current Biology;10.1016/j.cub.2004.08.064;Investigation of perceptual rivalry between conflicting stimuli presented one to each eye can further understanding of the neural underpinnings of conscious visual perception [1, 2]. During rivalry, visual awareness fluctuates between perceptions of the two stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that high-level perceptual grouping can promote rivalry between stimulus pairs that would otherwise be perceived as nonrivalrous. Perceptual grouping was generated with point-light walker stimuli that simulate human motion, visible only as lights placed on the joints. Although such walking figures are unrecognizable when stationary [3], recognition judgments as complex as gender [4, 5] and identity [6] can accurately be made from animated displays, demonstrating the efficiency with which our visual system can group dynamic local signals into a globally coherent walking figure. We find that point-light walker stimuli presented one to each eye and in different colors and configurations results in strong rivalry. However, rivalry is minimal when the two walkers are split between the eyes or both presented to one eye. This pattern of results suggests that processing animated walker figures promotes rivalry between signals from the two eyes rather than between higher-level representations of the walkers. This leads us to hypothesize that awareness during binocular rivalry involves the integrated activity of high-level perceptual mechanisms in conjunction with lower-level ocular suppression modulated via cortical feedback.
"Curby K.M.; Schyns P.G.; Gosselin F.; Gauthier I.";0.0;Differential use of spatial frequency scales for face recognition in a person with Asperger™ syndrome;2003;Journal of Vision;10.1167/3.9.821;"A previous fMRI study (Curby & Gauthier, 2002) found that RD, a patient with an Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), lacks a fusiform face area (FFA) for unfiltered images, consistent with previous ASD research (Schultz et al., 2000), but surprisingly has face-selective activity in the fusiform gyrus for HSF (high spatial frequency) images (Curby & Gauthier, 2002). Using Gosselin and Schyns' (2001) Bubbles technique, we measured RD's relative use of information from different spatial scales in a face identification task. Bubbles randomly reveals limited information from different locations and SF bandwidths, allowing for the computation of an effective face stimulus, based on RD's performance, depicting the information used for identification. Compared to 15 typical control participants from Schyns et al. (2002), RD not only uses much less information to identify the faces but also relies on a unique distribution of information from the different scales. Controls used relatively more information from mid-to-coarse scales (between 11 to 22 cycles per face) whereas RD appears to rely mostly on the fine scales (45 to 90 cycles per face). Using controls as a benchmark of information use, RD appeared to be more efficient with fine scale information (45 to 90 cycles per face). Efficiency progressively decreased with lower resolutions. RD's effective face stimulus appeared to be atypical with a dominance of the right eye compared to controls in which both eyes were well defined. The nose was also poorly defined suggesting this feature plays little role in identification for RD. The results combined with RD's fMRI activity pattern are consistent with recent work suggesting that the FFA operates on inputs that are segregated for different spatial scales (Gauthier et al., 2002; Eger et al., 2002). Further studies are required to establish if this bias for HSF information is characteristic of ASD as this may provide a new perspective on visual processing in this population."

I contend here, however, that the usual methods of measurement are either too coarse or concentrate not on colour constancy itself, but on other, complementary aspects of scene perception. Whether colour constancy exists other than in nominal terms remains unclear.

"Blake R.; Sobel K.";0.0;Motion prolongs perceptual dominance during binocular rivalry;2003;Journal of Vision;10.1167/3.9.50;"Purpose: The reason for perceptual alternations during binocular rivalry remains debatable. Some believe that neural adaptation plays a key role in the alternation process while others construe alternations as an adaptive sampling of possible perceptual interpretations driven by an intrinsic oscillator. Using a novel display procedure, we have found that rivalry alternations can be substantially slowed when the rival targets themselves continuously move around the visual field, constantly shifting their neural representations onto fresh, unadapted neural tissue. Methods: During 2-min observation periods, observers maintained strict central fixation and used keypresses to report binocular rivalry alternations. On some trials the rival targets moved smoothly in tandem around an imaginary circle centered on the fixation point, and on the remaining trials the targets remained stationary at a given location on the circle's circumference. Results: Among a large sample of observers, dominance durations during the ""moving"" condition were typically quite long compared to their ""stationary"" durations, resulting in significantly slower alternation rates when the rival targets moved. Alternation rates were not slowed, however, when observers used pursuit eye movements to track the moving targets, thereby keeping the images of the targets on approximately the same retinal location. Alternations were reliably triggered when rival targets passed through a local region of the visual field that had been preadapted to one of the rival targets. There was no tendency for alternations, when they did occur, to coincide with transitions from one hemisphere to the other. Conclusions: Continuous movement of the rival targets may preclude local neural adaptation, leading to a relatively stable balance between excitatory and inhibitory interactions between the two competing neural representations."

Healthy adult male (n = 42), females (n = 45) right handers, and, male (n = 21), female (n = 20) left handers were studied. In each, 8 measurements of each of the limbs were taken, and the strength of the hands and feet determined. Hand and foot preferences were determined through 11 and 9 tasks respectively. Dominance in the eye, ear, taste and smell were ascertained by various tests. Right or left handedness and right footedness were clearly discernible but left footedness was indistinct. Right handedness was associated with dominant right upper limb and left handedness was associated with dominant left upper limb. Only right handers showed a dominant corresponding lower limb. Eyedness was related to handedness in males. Earedness and taste were associated with handedness in females. Smell had no relationship with handedness in both sexes. There was no interrelationship between handedness, footedness, eyedness, earedness, taste and smell.
Garaybayli G.Ch.;0.0;Neurophysiological pecularities of homosexualism;2004;Azerbaijan Medical Journal;0;Aim of investigation. To study functional brain asymmetry in persons with homosexual drive. Material and methods. Functional brain asymmetry was studied in 98 persons with homosexual drive and in 60 ones with heterosexual drive (control group). Studying of functional brain asymmetry of the examined persons was carried out by means of determining an individual profile of the functional asymmetry. Determination of individual profile of the functional asymmetry in the given investigation was carried out by identification of leading hand, leading foot and leading eye of the examined persons. Results. Significant decrease of degree of functional hemispheral laterization which is characteristic for organization of a male brain and significant increase of symmetry signs were discovered in persons with homosexual drive. The present fact testifies to the modified functional brain organization in those persons in comparison with control - heterosexual group. These data allow us to suppose that the features of the brain organization in persons with homosexual drive are characterized by a decrease of functional asymmetry and increase of bilateral degree and can relate to distortion of process of brain differentiation both in intrauterine and possibly in postnatal period. Thus, neurophysiologic disorders such as abnormalities in the interhemispheral relations should be considered as biological criterion of homosexual conduct.

This eye-target plane gradually shifted from aligning with the left eye (leftward targets) to between the two eyes (intermediate targets) to the right eye (rightward targets). We suggest that this occurs to optimize eye-hand alignment towards the eye with the best overall field of view. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized, unmasked clinical trial in which the nonoperated eye served as the control. METHODS: Four polymethylmethacrylate segments were surgically implanted in quadrantic scleral pockets created in the dominant eye of 29 emmetropic patients who were between the ages of 51 and 60 (mean age 54). Patients were examined preoperatively and up to 6 months postoperatively. The aforementioned tests were performed on the operated and control eye of each patient. Data were analyzed using two-sided rank tests. Medians, means, and standard deviations are provided for all measurements. RESULTS: Accommodative amplitude was measured monocularly using a near-point ""push"" technique from both a 70-cm and 30-cm starting point. An increase in accommodative amplitude of surgical eyes by +1.7 ± 1.5 diopters and +1.5 ± 1.2 diopters, at these two testing distances, respectively, was noted at 6 months postoperatively (P < .0001). A smaller increase was also seen in control eyes (+1.2 ± 1.1 diopters and +1.3 ± 1.2 diopters, respectively). There was notable intercenter variation in gains in accommodation, with three of seven centers showing significant improvement in near-point accommodative amplitudes relative to the others (P = .0003). There was a median improvement of uncorrected near acuity in surgical eyes by 0.3 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) at 30 and 40 cm and by 4 lines at 20 cm, with the difference in near acuity improvement at 6 months between SEB eyes and control eyes statistically significant at 20 cm (P < .030). Changes in spherical equivalence, axial length, and central keratometry readings were not statistically significant. There were no reports of anterior segment ischemia or malignant glaucoma. Adverse effects were limited to a transient elevation of intraocular pressure in one patient and misalignment of individual SEB segments, due to inadequate scleral pocket formation, in three patients. Only one SEB segment in one eye was replaced. It appears that the thickness and uniformity of the scleral belt loop is critical to the proper positioning and efficacy of the SEB segments. CONCLUSION: While the safety profile of SEB segments for the treatment of presbyopia was high, a modest improvement in near vision was noted in approximately half the patients using subjective methods of testing. The mechanisms that underlie improvement in near vision in the nonoperated eye await explanation. This may be due to a centrally controlled consensual response, potentiated convergence generating increased intravitreal pressure and hydraulic lift of the vitreo-zonular-lens diaphragm, or artifact from current testing techniques. Future studies of the SEB procedure should address the issue of intercenter variation by further standardizing and automating specific aspects of the surgical technique, as well as incorporating objective testing methods into the study design. © 2002 by Elsevier Science Inc.

This phenomenon is known as binocular rivalry. Although binocular rivalry occurs at locations where targets overlap spatially, the area surrounding rivalrous targets can modulate their dominance. Here we show that during binocular rivalry of oppositely moving gratings, a surrounding grating moving in the same direction as one of the two leads to increased dominance of the opposite direction of motion in the center. This increased dominance of the opposite direction in the center was observed irrespective of the eye to which the surround was presented. Inspection of the results for different conditions reveals that the preference for the opposite direction of motion cannot be explained by a single mechanism operating beyond binocular fusion. We therefore suggest that this phenomenon is the outcome of center-surround interactions at multiple levels along the pathway of visual motion processing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
"Roth H.L.; Lora A.N.; Heilman K.M.";0.0;Effects of monocular viewing and eye dominance on spatial attention;2002;Brain;10.1093/brain/awf210;Observations in primates and patients with unilateral spatial neglect have suggested that patching of the eye ipsilateral to the injury and contralateral to the neglected space can sometimes improve attention to the neglected space. Investigators have generally attributed the effects of monocular eye patching to activation of subcortical centers that interact with cortical attentional systems. Eye patching is thought to produce preferential activation of attentional systems contralateral to the viewing eye. In this study we examined the effect of monocular eye patching on attentional biases in normal subjects. When normal subjects bisect vertical (radial) lines using both eyes, they demonstrate a far attentional bias, misbisecting lines away from their body. In a monocular viewing experiment, we found that the majority of subjects, who were right eye dominant, had relatively nearer bisections and a diminished far bias when they used their right eye (left eye covered) compared with when they used their left eye (right eye covered). The smaller group of subjects who were left eye dominant had relatively nearer bisections and a diminished far bias when they used their left eye compared with when they used their right eye. In the hemispatial placement experiment, we directly manipulated hemispheric engagement by having subjects perform the same task in right and left hemispace. We found that right eye dominant subjects had a diminished far bias in right hemispace relative to left hemispace. Left eye dominant subjects showed the opposite pattern and had a diminished far bias in left hemispace. For both groups, spatial presentation affected performance more for the non-dominant eye. The results suggest that monocular viewing is associated with preferential activation of attentional systems in the contralateral hemisphere, and that the right hemisphere (at least in right eye dominant subjects) is biased towards far space. Finally, the results suggest that the poorly understood phenomenon of eye dominance may be related to hemispheric specialization for visual attention.

Method: Male subjects (n=8) were exposed for 20 min to limonene oxidation products (LOPs), isoprene oxidation products (IOPs), nitrate radicals (NO3), their residual reactants, and clean air at 20% relative humidity. A baseline blink frequency was measured prior to and following each exposure (2×8 min). The subjects were exposed locally in the non-dominant eye and single blind in random order. Blinking was video-recorded and evaluated for full sessions of 36 min while the subjects viewed an educational film. The initial terpene concentrations were one to two orders of magnitude higher than mean indoor concentrations. Results: The mean blink frequency increased significantly during subjects' exposure to gas-phase oxidation products at lower part-per-billion (ppb) levels of LOPs, 42% (P<0.0001) and NO3, 21% (P<0.022), compared with that at baseline. Neither the residual reactants nor clean air changed the blink frequency significantly. The findings coincided with qualitative reporting of weak eye irritation symptoms. Conclusions: Changes in blink frequency appear to be a promising measure of trigeminal stimulation from exposure to eye irritants in ppb levels. Gaseous products of limonene and ozone, and reactive radicals may cause eye irritation indoors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.
"Kim Y.J.; Grabowecky M.; Suzuki S.";0.0;Stochastic resonance in bistable binocular rivalry;2003;Journal of Vision;10.1167/3.9.54;"When a different stimulus is presented to each eye, the perceived image spontaneously and stochastically alternates between the two stimuli (binocular rivalry). The dynamics of perceptual bistability can be modeled by a system consisting of two potential energy minima, corresponding to the two predominantly perceived images, with internal stochastic noise (e.g., spontaneous neural discharge) generating the spontaneous perceptual shifts. We investigated the properties of this model by examining how the binocular rivalry responded to an external periodic signal. The relative strengths (contrast) of the left-eye and right-eye stimuli were oscillated at various frequencies and amplitudes, while observers continuously reported dynamic alternations between the two perceived images. Distributions of dominance phase durations were obtained for various driving frequencies and for the non-driven control. Synchronization of binocular rivalry was indexed by an increase (relative to the non-driven control) in the ""resonant"" component of the dominance phase durations matching the half-period of the driving oscillation (i.e. matching the driving frequency). We found evidence of stochastic resonance in that the proportion of the resonant component within each dominance-phase distribution was maximal when the driving frequency was near the mean alternation frequency in the non-driven control (Kramer's rate). By analyzing the dependence of the dominance-phase distribution on the driving frequency and amplitude, we inferred the relationship between the depth of the two potential minima and the intensity of the internal noise for the double-well potential model."
"James K.H.; Humprey G.K.; Goodale M.A.";0.0;Viewpoint preferences during the exploration of novel 3D objects;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.46;A set of studies was conducted that investigated how participants explored the three-dimensional structure of novel objects. Participants rotated a virtual object on a computer screen about any axis to learn the objects' 3-D structure. Their exploration patterns were recorded and revealed that participants focused on a limited number of views of these objects, specifically 'plan' views that were defined as 'front' (axis of elongation is parallel to the line of sight), 'side' (axis of elongation is perpendicular to the line of sight) and 'back' views. In contrast, views that were 'intermediate' or half way between the front and side views were virtually ignored. These results were found in studies that presented the objects on a computer monitor and in a study that presented the objects in a fully immersive virtual reality environment. These findings suggest that storing these plan views of the objects may be important for subsequent recognition of novel objects. In fact, we found in a related study that studying plan views results in faster subsequent recognition than studying intermediate views. The reasons why plan views may be important for creating stored object representations will be discussed.
"Watanabe K.; Paik Y.; Blake R.";0.0;Preserved gain control for luminance contrast during binocular rivalry suppression;2004;Vision Research;10.1016/j.visres.2004.07.011;Binocular rivalry elevates contrast increment thresholds for the detection of a transient stimulus presented to the suppressed eye, while thresholds measured during dominance are identical to those during monocular viewing (e.g. [Wales, R., & Fox, R. (1970). Increment detection thresholds during binocular rivalry suppression. Perception and Psychophysics, 8, 90-94]). It is well established that contrast increment thresholds depend on reference (pedestal) contrast. With high contrasts, increment thresholds increase with pedestal contrast, reflecting a gain control with sigmoidal non-linearity. We examined how this gain control mechanism operates during binocular rivalry (i.e., with and without perception of a pedestal mask). Subjects viewed a horizontal sine-wave grating (steady pedestal) and a radial checkerboard dichoptically. When the grating achieved a pre-specified phenomenal state (dominance or suppressed), subjects initiated the transient presentation (500-ms Gaussian pulse) of a contrast increment of the same spatial frequency. The pulse appeared in either the upper or lower half of the pedestal. Subjects indicated which half of the pedestal contained the pulse. Contrast increment thresholds were measured using a staircase method with various pedestal contrasts, which yielded threshold versus contrast (TvC) functions during dominance and suppression. The measured thresholds were reliably higher during suppression, but the rising slopes of TvC functions did not differ significantly between dominance and suppression (i.e., constant upward shift of TvC function). A control experiment demonstrated that the TvC function during dominance was identical to that during non-rivalry, monocular viewing. Evidently, the contrast gain control for transient luminance increment does not require the perception of pedestal contrast. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Readinger W.O.;0.0;Representing and partitioning visual space: Applying isovist field theory to human perception;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.515;"For several decades, isovist field theory (also known as viewshed analysis) has been an increasingly popular method of representing visual space in architectural and geographical analyses. Little attempt has been made, though, to apply this method to the psychology of perception, despite its marked similarity to James Gibson's notions of vistas and transitions within the optical array. To this end, in an initial experiment, priming images of a particular viewpoint towards a portion of the visual space were presented. Subjects were significantly (p<0.05) more accurate in reproducing the spatial locations of objects in the scene when a briefly presented view of the objects (300ms) was taken from within the viewshed of a primed scene, compared to an equidistant view taken from outside the viewshed. The intervisibility of locations in space appears to act as a cue for orientation to the layout of the environment. In a second experiment, subjects showed a high degree of consistency in their judgments of the inf informativeness of particular viewpoints within a large, complex space. No significant change in preference was found for views which maximized the overall area of visibility, but informativeness ratings were greatest for those views which contained transitions between adjacent vistas. Further analysis revealed that the viewpoints judged to be most valuable for navigation and orientation can often be represented by unique isovists (those which completely define the space that can be seen from a particular vantage point) within the spatial layout of the structure. Methods for defining ""functional isovists"" (changes in the viewshed across time and movement of an agent) are developed, and can account for the results of this experiment. The relationship between isovist methods of quantifying space and human perceptions will be discussed, as well as the usefulness of this technique for interpreting the spatial experience of active agents in the environment."

It was observed that when a subject pointing an object in the real space, the figure of the index finger was overlapped on or near from that of the pointed object in the dominant eye's image. It was also observed that the distance between index finger's figure and pointed object's figure on the dominant eye's image was not changed while distance to the object is increased.

Setting: Eye Clinic, Kitasato University School of Medicine Hospital, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. Methods: The durations of exclusive visibility of dominant- and nondominant-eye targets were measured in 16 patients with successful monovision and 4 patients with unsuccessful monovision to determine the characteristics of ocular dominance. The dominant eye was determined using the hole-in-card test (sighting dominance). The contrast of target in nondominant eye was fixed at 100%; the contrast of target in the dominant eye varied (ie, 100% to 80% to 60% to 40% to 20%) using rectangular gratings of 2 cycles per degree that were 4 degrees in size. Results: In the successful monovision group, the reversal thresholds (ie, exclusive visibility of the nondominant eye crosses over that of the dominant eye) were displayed only at low decreasing contrast (80% and 60%). However, in the unsuccessful monovision group, the reversal thresholds were at high decreasing contrast (20%) or not at all. The reversal thresholds in patients with unsuccessful monovision were at a significantly lower contrast than in patients with successful monovision (P<.05). Conclusions: Success and patient satisfaction in monovision patients were significantly influenced by the magnitude of ocular dominance. The balance technique seems to be a good method to evaluate the quantity of ocular dominance and prospectively evaluate the monovision technique. © 2004 ASCRS and ESCRS."

Hand preference was assessed on the Edinburg Handedness Inventory. Nonverbal intelligence was assessed with Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test. In a prior study, the percentage of left-eye preference had been reported to be greater for mathematics students than for nonmathematics students. In the present study there were positive correlations between hand preference and the sum of the monocular shifts of two eyes. In addition, there was a negative correlation between nonverbal intelligence and the sum of the monocular shifts of two eyes. As these results suggest that the sum of the monocular shifts of two eyes may be related to mathematical ability and nonverbal intelligence, further research with a larger sample including nonmathematics students is needed.

This asymmetry has been cited as evidence of inhibitory effects from the prior trial. We examined accuracy and latency costs of task-switching between prosaccades and antisaccades, where task-switching is limited to stimulus-response re-mapping and occurs between tasks highly asymmetric in dominance. Eighteen subjects executed prosaccades and antisaccades in single-task and mixed-task blocks. In mixed-task blocks, antisaccade and prosaccade trials were ordered randomly, resulting in 'repeated' trials that were preceded by the same type of trial (i.e. antisaccade-antisaccade), and 'switched' trials that were preceded by the opposite type of trial. Comparisons of the single-task blocks and repeated trials of the mixed-task blocks indexed the mixed-list costs, which were small for prosaccades and insignificant for antisaccades. Comparison of the repeated and switched trials from the mixed-task blocks indexed the residual task-switch cost. Accuracy costs of task-switching and antisaccades were equivalent. The accuracy of trials incorporating both switching and antisaccades in a single response (i.e. switched antisaccade) equalled the product of the accuracies of doing each operation alone, supporting independence of these two functions. In contrast, the latency cost of antisaccade performance was 3 times greater than that of task-switching. Task-switching from prosaccades to antisaccades resulted in a paradoxical decrease in antisaccade latency. This decrease correlated with other indices of vigilance, with the paradoxical effect minimized in more attentive observers. The latency data suggest that either an antisaccade on the prior trial perturbs saccadic responses more than a task-switch, or concurrent task-switching specifically facilitates antisaccades. In either case, the paradoxical benefit of task-switching for antisaccades challenges current models of task-switching.
"Li S.; Farell B.";0.0;Coarse-to-fine or fine-to-coarse?;2003;Journal of Vision;10.1167/3.9.454;If stereo channels of different scales were truly independent of each other, the components of a surface with a large disparity would appear smeared out across space. Instead, we see a single solid surface. To identify factors behind this perceptual coherence, we investigated interactions among the components of a squarewave grating. The target stimulus consisted of squarewave components with independently manipulated disparities. The fundamental (F) was placed in one depth plane, while the higher frequency components (mF - missing fundamental) were placed together in another depth plane. The task was to compare the perceived depth of the whole target stimulus to that of a conventional squarewave with the same spatial frequency (0.4 cpd) and contrast (20%) but varying disparity. For all four observers, F and mF cohered in depth: The appearance of the target was indistinguishable from a conventional squarewave when F and mF were in cyclopean phase. The perceived depth of the target was consistent with the disparity of mF. Randomizing the relative phase between F and mF changed the appearance of the target, but not its perceived depth. Removing the 3F component from mF changed the appearance of the target but did not alter the coherence. For one of the two observers, this switched the perceived depth to be consistent with the disparity of F. But increasing the contrast of the 5F component re-established the dominance of the higher harmonics. Perceived depth is determined by interactions among stereo spatial frequency channels. These interactions can be either coarse-to-fine or fine-to-coarse. The direction of the interaction depends on the relative salience of all the competitive scales. Therefore, Marr and Poggio's coarse-to-fine direction of interaction is not unique.

Two possible kicker strategies have been described: ignoring the goalkeeper action (open loop) or trying to react to the goalkeeper action (closed loop). We used a paradigm simulating a penalty kick in the laboratory to investigate the dynamics of the closed-loop strategy in these controlled conditions. The probability of correctly responding to the simulated goalkeeper motion as a function of time available followed a logistic curve. Kickers on average reached perfect performance only if the goalkeeper committed him or herself to one side about 400 ms before ball contact and showed chance performance if the goalkeeper motion occurred less than 150 ms before ball contact. Interestingly, coincidence judgement - another aspect of the laboratory responses - appeared to be affected for a much longer time (> 500 ms) than was needed to correctly determine laterality. The present study is meant as groundwork for experiments in more ecological conditions applicable to kickers and goalkeepers.
"Peterzell D.H.; Werner J.S.";0.0;Rod spatial channels and adult aging: Implications for analysis of development of infant spatial vision;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.10.90;"Purpose. We extracted spatial channels underlying scotopic contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) of normal adult observers, and compared them to channels underlying photopic contrast sensitivity functions. Methods. Scotopic CSFs were measured on 50 observers between the ages of 20 and 88 years (Schefrin et al. 1999). These CSFs were measured psychophysically using 2AFC at 7 spatial frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 c/deg, with mean retinal illuminance equated for observers at -0.85 log scotopic Trolands. Results. A covariance analysis of individual differences was applied to the data. We computed statistical sources of individual variability, used them to define ""covariance channels,"" and determined the number and frequency tuning of these channels. We found evidence for 3 discrete channels operating below 3 c/deg. Two covariance channels operated primarily above 1 c/deg, and were predicted and well fit by a computational model of photopic vision (Wilson &Gelb, 1984; mechanisms ""A"" and ""B""). A third channel, unlike channels found for photopic vision, was optimally tuned to very low spatial frequencies (approximately 0.3 c/deg). Conclusions. (1) The results are consistent with previous investigations indicating that channels tuned below 1 c/deg exist for scotopic but not photopic vision. However, the difference between photopic and scotopic mechanisms appears to be a single low spatial frequency channel. (2) The results have implications for understanding channel development. Channel tuning data from infants are generally consistent with the idea that channels shift in scale from lower to higher spatial frequencies with age, due to cone migration into the fovea and changes in eye size. However,the presence of a low spatial frequency channel in infants could merely reflect a shift from rod- to cone-dominated vision."

Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the SCRA gene to chromosome 11p15 in 81 patients from a large founder pedigree in Iceland. The parametric LOD score obtained was 18.9 using an autosomal dominant model with high penetrance. Crossover analysis of the linkage region with 51 markers identified a 593 kb segment shared by all patients. Sequencing exons of the only gene in this interval, the transcriptional enhancer TEAD1, revealed a novel missense mutation (Y421H) carried by all patients and none of the 502 controls. The mutation is in a conserved amino acid sequence in the C terminal of the protein, a potential binding site for YAP65 one of TEAD1's cofactors that is expressed in human retina as well as TEAD1 based on RT-PCR experiments. Therefore, we conclude that the mutation in the TEAD1 gene is the cause of Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved."

The present study describes a quantitative analysis method for this purpose. A chiasmal coefficient (CC) was calculated by correlating the differential potential over left and right hemisphere, when stimulating left versus right eye. This CC will be negative in albinism and positive in normal individuals. VEPs were recorded in 20 control subjects, four children with congenital motor nystagmus and six children with albinism. In up to 25% of the controls the CC was negative, when using flash VEP. However, with pattern VHP all had a positive CC. All children with albinism had a negative CC. Three of the four patients with congenital motor nystagmus had a positive CC, and one child had a small negative value with flash stimulation. In conclusion, determination of CC is a valuable and objective analysis method for electrophysiological determination of chiasmal misrouting. The method is relatively simple and only needs two electrode tracings. One should be aware of false-positive results when using flash stimulation. Whenever possible pattern stimulation should be used.

Neuropsychological studies have suggested that such perseverative behaviors may be due to underlying attentional deficits. Inhibition of return (IOR) is an adaptive mechanism that is thought to assist visual search by biasing attention after a critical, short interval to novel, previously unattended areas. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether deficient IOR mechanisms could underlie some of the attentional, and perhaps behavioral, problems, reported in OCD patients. Using a computerized IOR paradigm, participants were required to respond to a target that appeared at either the same or different location to a precue that was presented either 100 ms or 700 ms earlier. Results indicate that patients had a reduced IOR for targets presented in the left visual field, suggesting lateralized anomalies in shifting attention. Results are consistent with lateralization anomalies previously reported in OCD.
"Gepshtein S.; Banks M.S.; Levitan C.A.";0.0;How sight and touch are combined depends on viewing geometry;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.399;We studied how the brain combines information from sight and touch in size perception. Contrary to earlier views that sight always dominates touch, recent evidence shows that the more visual information is corrupted by external noise, the more perceived size depends on touch. We asked whether touch information affects size perception when size is hard to measure visually. In a 2-IFC procedure, each interval contained two planes. Observers indicated the interval containing the more widely separated planes. Visual stimuli were depicted with stereograms, and touch (haptic) stimuli with force-feedback devices (PHANToMs). The planes were presented in three orientations: (1) perpendicular to the line of sight so the separation had to be judged from disparity-specified depth alone, (2) parallel to the line of sight so the separation could be judged from 2-D separation, and (3) 45 deg relative to the line of sight. Observers made size discriminations for these orientations with vision alone (V task), touch alone (T task), and with vision and touch together (VT task). In the VT task, the visual and haptic sizes were the same in one interval and differed in the other. We found that the just-discriminable separation in the V task depended on the planes orientation: it was significantly higher when they were perpendicular as opposed to parallel to the line of sight. Performance in the T task did not depend on orientation. Because the visual estimates varied with orientation and the touch estimates did not, optimal use of the two sources of information predicts visual dominance in the parallel orientation and more touch influence in the perpendicular orientation. Results in the VT task were very consistent with this prediction. Thus, the brain combines information from sight and touch in a way that depends on stimulus orientation. This is evidence that the weights given to sight and touch vary according to the relative reliabilities of the two information sources.

London: Erlbaum) proposes that inhibition of previously attended loci (Inhibition of return; IOR) serves to facilitate exploration by increasing the likelihood to inspect new areas instead of returning to locations that have been inspected before. In this eye movement study we tested whether we could find evidence in favor of this hypothesis. Here we report that IOR does occur during search and free viewing, because we found increased fixation times preceding return saccades (eye movements that return to previously fixated locations). Meanwhile we observed no influence of IOR on the search strategy. Rather than the predicted low number we found many return saccades. Therefore, IOR does not serve as a foraging facilitator in saccadic search and free viewing. We hypothesize that IOR is an intrinsic aspect of shifting attention and gaze direction and furthermore that it is not always advantageous to prevent return saccades. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigates the incidence of left-eye and crossed hand-eye dominance in patience with schizophrenia (n = 68), panic disorder (n = 62), personality disorder (n = 35), heroin addiction (n = 54), and mental retardation (n = 33), in comparison with controls (n = 944). All psychiatric groups, except the group with panic disorder, had significantly greater frequency of left-eye dominance than the control group. Furthermore, all psychiatric groups, except the personality-disordered group, had significantly greater frequency of crossed hand-eye dominance than the control group. These findings further support the evidence of an anomaly in hemispheric lateralization among different psychiatric populations, particularly among those with psychotic symptoms and cognitive deficits.
Romano P.E.;0.0;A case of acute loss of binocular vision and stereoscopic depth perception. (The misery of acute monovision, having been binocular for 68 years);2003;Binocular Vision and Strabismus Quarterly;0;"Purpose: There are few personal reports in the literature, by knowledgeables vision scientists, of the loss of binocular vision. This case is reported. Case Report: This 68 year old retired pediatric ophthalmologist suffered an almost total loss of vision, OD, as a result of a sudden massive hemorrhage into the vitreous body from a bridging retinal vessel, which remained after repair of a spontaneous large horseshoe retinal tear. This caused significant problems with both remaining monocular vision, cognition, and space perception. It was surprisingly disabling. A diary is included. Result: The author now appreciates better: 1. that the overlap and cross compensation of monocular vision is quite significant; 2. that monocular depth perception may be impaired by any type of intervening optical media; 3. that a two dimensional world is very different and vastly inferior to a three dimensionsal world. Comment: Such problems are not ordinarily expected or described in these circumstances, but considering what is in the literature, they may be more common and serious than assumed by eye care professionals, and should be taken into consideration in rendering eye care in similar situations. Loss of binocular vision results in a significant handicap even when the vision remaining in the good dominant eye is normal. It is truly remarkable to this victim that so many mature patients are willing to accept this situation in the form of surgical or optical monovision to avoid spectacles for presbyopia."

The side bias questionnaire included 24 items for handedness and 4 each for footedness, eyedness, and earedness. Subjects were asked to report their preferences of a given side (such as handedness) on a 5-point scale for each item (1 = left always, 5 = right always). Log-linear analyses showed cultural differences in direction and degree of the side biases on some items, but not in the prevalence of each side bias. In both Japanese and Indian subjects, the prevalence, especially of handedness and footedness, was lower in comparison to Western data (Porac & Coren, 1981), and associations between the side biases were all significant. Predictions for the associations made by the right shift theory (Annett, 2000) fitted generally well with observed frequencies.

Part I: The unperceived stimulus affects the very first dominance epoch;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.461;"Levelt (1967) found an intriguing relation between the strength of binocular rivalry stimuli and their dominance durations. When one eye's stimulus is strengthened (eg by increasing contrast), the mean dominance duration of that eye does not change; instead, the mean duration of the other (unaffected) eye decreases. This observation imposes significant constraints on models of rivalry. Here we propose that it is particularly useful for testing different accounts of the role of adaptation in rivalry. Adaptation is commonly thought to be involved in bi-stable alternations. But the relative role of a decay in strength of the dominant (perceived) stimulus versus a recovery from adaptation of the suppressed (unperceived) stimulus is not known. We addressed this by examining the duration of the very first dominance epoch. Methods: Contrast was manipulated for each eye independently in a full-factorial design. Trials were sorted based on which eye was dominant first, and the mean duration of the first epoch was calculated for each eye. Results: Levelt's observation holds already in the first dominance epoch; the mean duration of the first stimulus seen depended on the contrast of the (as yet unperceived) stimulus projected to the other eye. In the next abstract (Part II, Hupér and Rubin) we present evidence that Levelt's result can be generalized to bi-stable motion displays, and there, too, we find that the effect of the unperceived percept on the dominance duration of the other percept is present already in the first dominance epoch. Conclusions: These results cast a doubt on models which make use of recovery from adaptation of the suppressed stimulus to explain Levelt's result. In the very first dominance epoch, the suppressed stimulus is not yet adapted: it is not only unperceived at that moment - it has not been perceived (dominant) at all yet. These observations impose new, stronger constraints on models of bi-stable perception."

Subjects and Methods: Thirty (91%) of 33 subjects contacted who participated in three similar 7-week, longitudinal dosing studies returned for follow-up. The three previous studies were undertaken approximately 27 (study 1), 21 (study 2), and 9 (study 3) months prior to this follow-up test session. All subjects received L-dopa for 7 weeks combined with part-time occlusion of the dominant eye after the termination of standard, occlusion only, therapy. Some subjects in study 2 received L-dopa without occlusion. Sixteen subjects with amblyopia who received occlusion only served as a control group. Results: Subjects who received L-dopa plus occlusion demonstrated significant, but similar, amounts of regression of visual acuity from the end of their respective L-dopa studies to the follow-up test session. Subjects in study 1 regressed 1.3 lines, subjects in study 2 regressed 1.5 lines, and subjects in study 3 regressed 1.4 lines. The control group regressed, on average, 1.1 lines. This was similar to the overall regression found in the groups receiving L-dopa plus occlusion. Subjects in study 2 who received L-dopa without occlusion regressed 2.1 lines, significantly more than the occlusion only group or the L-dopa plus occlusion group. Conclusions: Children with amblyopia show similar amounts of regression of visual acuity after therapy with L-dopa plus occlusion and after therapy with occlusion only. Given that therapy with L-dopa plus occlusion initially improved visual acuity by approximately 1.7 lines following the termination of standard therapy, L-dopa plus occlusion may reset baseline visual acuity and lead to long-term improvement in visual acuity after recidivism.
"Kaiser M.; Lappe M.";0.0;Perisaccadic compression of space orthogonal to saccade direction;2002;Journal of Vision;10.1167/2.7.173;Objects flashed before or during a saccade are perceived as shifted towards the saccade target. A possible interpretation is that the target attracts the object. If that would be the case, one would also expect a vertical shift for horizontal saccades. Here we show that a shift in the object's perceived position orthogonal to saccade direction does occur, but only for stimulus positions beyond the target. Three subjects made horizontal saccades towards a target (20 deg to the right) in front of a red screen. A green dot (1.2 deg) was presented for 12ms before, during or after the saccade. The dot's position was chosen randomly from a 5x5 grid (8x8 deg) centered around the target. After the saccade, the subject reported the object position by setting a mouse pointer. We found that shortly before and during a saccade dots presented left to the target were shifted in horizontal direction. Dots presented to the right of the target, however, were also shifted vertically towards the target position. In a second experiment we used vertical saccades (20 deg downwards) to test whether transferring information from one hemisphere to the other during remapping or lateralization could account for different results of left and right hemifield. A component of mislocalization orthogonal to saccade direction (i.e. horizontal) occured below the target. We conclude that the shift towards the target can also have a component orthogonal to saccade direction both for horizontal and vertical saccades. This effect is limited to objects presented in the space beyond the target. We propose that different kinds of visual processing occur for spatial areas before and beyond the target.
"Dragovic M.; Allet L.; Janca A.";0.0;Electroconvulsive therapy and determination of cerebral dominance;2004;Annals of General Hospital Psychiatry;10.1186/1475-2832-3-14;"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) often results in a number of short- and long-time side effects including memory impairment for past and current events, which can last for several months after ECT treatment. It has been suggested that unilateral ECT (uECT) with electrodes placed over the non-dominant (typically right) hemisphere significantly reduces side effects, especially memory disturbances. It is important to note that cerebral dominance equates to speech dominance and avoiding this area of the brain also reduces speech dysfunction after ECT. Traditionally, the routine clinical determination of cerebral dominance has been through the assessment of hand, foot and eye dominance, which is an easy and inexpensive approach that, however, does not ensure accuracy. This review of literature on different methods and techniques for determination of cerebral dominance and provides evidence that functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) represents a valid and safe alternative to invasive techniques for identifying speech lateralisation. It can be concluded that fTCD, notwithstanding its costs, could be used as a standard procedure prior to uECT treatment to determine cerebral dominance, thereby further reducing cognitive side-effects of ECT and possibly making it more acceptable to both patients and clinicians. © 2004 Dragovic et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
"Tian S.; Lennerstrand G.; Nishida Y.; Tallstedt L.";0.0;Eye muscle force development and saccadic velocity in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy;2003;Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology;10.1007/s00417-003-0696-7;Background: Ocular motility disturbances are very common in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). The force duction test has demonstrated that limitations of eye movements may be caused by mechanical restrictions in the muscles. A quantitative evaluation of isometric force production and ocular motility in all directions of gaze could further elucidate the mechanism of the movement disorder. Methods: In eight patients with TAO and eight controls of the same age range, horizontal and vertical saccadic movements of both eyes were recorded by means of electrooculography (EOG). The corresponding force development in muscles of the more affected eye in patients and the non-dominant eye in normals was measured, using a suction contact lens/strain gauge technique. Results: Steady-state tension in the patients was increased in all directions of gaze both horizontally and vertically, most markedly for vertical fixations in the upper field of gaze. However, peak tension was increased only for the downward movements in the upper field of gaze and for the horizontal movements in the abduction field of gaze. Vertical saccadic velocity was slower than normal in downward movements, and horizontal saccadic velocity was reduced in the abduction field of gaze. Conclusion: The increased active eye muscle tension in different directions of gaze could represent an adaptational mechanism of the ocular motor system to overcome the eye movement restriction in TAO.

"Job A.; Grateau P.; Picard J.";0.0;Intrinsic differences in hearing performances between ears revealed by the asymmetrical shooting posture in the army;1998;Hearing Research;10.1016/S0378-5955(98)00104-X;Left ear noise-induced hearing losses are dominant in the army. The common explanation is the asymmetrical effect of the shooting posture. However, firm evidence to support this possibility is still lacking. In the French army shooters, eye preference rather than hand preference for shooting determines the side of shooting and hence the ear more exposed to noise. To test whether left-right asymmetry of hearing thresholds really relates to the shooting posture, we analyzed audiograms from 644 officers of the infantry and artillery branches. The interaural differences reached 7 dB for right- eyed subjects, and less, about 5 dB, for left-eyed subjects at 6-7 kHZ, both with disadvantage for the left ear. In contrast, hearing thresholds of both groups in the low frequency range were significantly better for left ears. Our results suggest each ear has different intrinsic characteristics. The right cochlea might be a less sensitive but more robust sensor than the left cochlea, which might be a finer sensor but more sensitive to noise.
"Weekes B.; Bi Y.Z.";0.0;Chinese character recognition in the left and right visual fields;1999;Brain and Cognition;0;We report an experiment investigating the effect of priming on the recognition of Chinese characters in the left visual field (LVF) and the right visual field (RVF). Two types of character were used: compound targets, which contain separate radical components, and integrated targets, which do not contain separate components. Phonological priming effects on compound target recognition were found following a 50-ms SOA, but these were restricted to the RVF. There was no evidence of phonological priming on integrated target recognition in either visual field. We argue that character type constrains the activation of phonology during Chinese character recognition and that this is primarily a left hemisphere activity for Chinese speakers.
"Furber J.E.; Spry P.G.D.; Harrad R.A.";0.0;Does binocular rivalry affect visual field analysis 9;1997;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;0;Purpose. During perimetry some patients describe transient darkening and subjective loss of sensitivity in the eye under test. This phenomenon appears to occur despite adequate adaptation to test conditions- It is probable that this is due to binocular rivalry producing inhibition of the non-occluded eye. Binocular rivalry occurs when non-fusible images are presented independently to either eye. In order to see whether binocular rivalry may affect full threshold visual field analysis we tested ocular dominance and questioned for symptoms in a group of patients undergoing perimetry Method. Full threshold 24-2 visual fields were performed on both eyes of 55 subjects. Each subjects ocular dominance was determined by questioning and a test of ocular dominance was undertaken. Perimetry was performed with an opaque black patch occluding the non-tested eye. After testing, patients were asked to report any symptoms of visual disturbance experienced. The relationship between dominance and symptoms of rivalry was investigated. Evidence of rivalry affecting visual function was sought by assessment of increased short term fluctuation or false negative values. Differences in these variables between those with and without rivalry were assessed. Results. 24 of 55 subjects reported symptoms of rivalry (44%). 16 complained of the phenomenon in one eye and 8 in both. Of the 16 experiencing rivalry in one eye only, 9 cases occurred during occlusion of the dominant eye, and 7 during non-dominant. The association between ocular dominance and rivalry was not found to be significant (p = 0.10). There was found to be no significant difference between eyes with and without rivalry for both short term fluctuation (p = 0.78) or false negative errors (p= 0.10). Conclusions. Although symptoms of rivalry are commonly reported by patients undergoing perimetry, this does not appear to cause increased variability in visual function during testing Binocular rivalry experienced whilst wearing an opaque occluder does not appear to affect visual field analysis.

We performed penetrating keratoplasty on the right eye and studied the affected cornea histopathologically in a 69-year-old male we diagnosed with Schnyder's corneal dystrophy and followed since 1987. The patient's left eye had been enucleated because of an ocular injury in 1957. In 1996 we performed penetrating keratoplasty, extracapsular cataract extraction and implantation of an intraocular lens in the right eye to treat severe visual loss due to advanced corneal opacity and cataract. On histopathological study, sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin showed no crystalloid material. However, on sections stained with oil red O, red granules were noted all over the stroma, including the edge of Descemet's membrane. Schultz staining, which is a specific stain for cholesterol, showed no evidence of cholesterol. On ultramicroscopic examination, many vacuoles containing electron-dense material were seen between the lamellae throughout the stroma. Microvacuoles were also seen inside the keratocytes and endothelial cells.

Use of ventral fins by blue gourami was investigated during initial exploration of novel objects. When exposed to a sequence of novel plastic objects, varying in shape and colour, the blue gourami showed preferential use of the left fin during initial contacts. Laterality apparently depends on the nature of the stimulus: Fish exposed to a randomized series of natural objects showed preferential use of the left fin for inanimate mineral objects, but no asymmetry was apparent for investigating animate objects. This would suggest that some form of 'handedness' may have been present prior to the appearance of tetrapods. On the other hand, measurements of fish monocular viewing revealed that the fin use was strongly associated with preferential use of the ipsilateral eye before the touching of the stimulus took place, thus, suggesting that the asymmetry in fin use may also be related to lateralization of the visual system. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The original measure suggested by Cohen for use with nominal data has since been generalized in a number of ways, including the incorporation of weights, adaptation for use with more than one rater and the application to bivariate data. Each modification requires a new approximation to the standard error and these have usually been derived by the delta method. This paper illustrates the use of estimating equations for kappa which offer a unified approach to many previously considered situations and which is also applicable to more complex designs.

Here we analyze the dominant eye mutation Glazed (Gla) that was described by T. H. Morgan more than 50 years ago. We show that Gla causes the loss of photoreceptor cells during pupal stages, in a process reminiscent of apoptosis, with a concomitant overproduction of eye pigment. This phenotype is very similar to that caused by the loss of D-APC, a negative regulator of Wingless (Wg) signal transduction. Genetic analyses reveal however that the Gla gain-of-function phenotype can be reverted to wild-type. By generating a P-element-induced revertant of Gla we demonstrate that Gla is allelic to wg. The molecular lesion in Gla indicates that the insertion of a roo retrotransposon leads to ectopic expression of wg during pupal stages. We show that the Gla phenotype is similar to that caused by ectopic expression of Wg driven by the sevenless (sev) enhancer. In both cases Wg exerts its effect, at least in part, by negatively regulating the expression of the Pax2 homolog sparkling (spa). Gla represents not only the first dominant allele of wg, but it may also be the first allele ever described for wg.

A total of 2605 subjects (1306 males and 1299 females) were inquired by a special questionnaire. It was found that 3.60% of the Bulgarians are lift-handed and with left eye-dominance, 2,72% are lift-handed and with right eye-dominance, 18,06% are right-handed and with left eye-dominance, and 75,62% are right-handed and with right eye-dominance. The date are similar to the date for some South-European countries. An ipsilateral combination was found in more than half of cases, in both right- and left-handers, although a crossed lateralization of handedness and eye-dominance appeared more frequently in left-handers. Significant sex differences were observed in some of the subgroups. Our data support the view that handedness and eyedness are neither intimately linked nor completely unassociated.

An analysis of new data relating to these three modalities, as collated from counter-balanced groups of normally sighted male and female children and adults examined in optometric practice, confirms the general fallacy of this assumption and considers why it is such a persistent misconception. The degree of association between the three modalities in right-preferent individuals is revealed as statistically no greater than chance. On the basis of this study, estimates of right-sided hand, eye and/or acuity congruency are derived for the information of the clinician in the prescribing environment of the consulting room.

Methods: Thirty volunteers with normal vision were enrolled in this study. Three methods were used to determine ocular dominance: (1) the ""hole in the card"" method, (2) asking the subject which eye sees an object when the object is brought into the visual field from the side of the dominant eye or (3) from the side of the non-dominant eye. To measure (2) and (3), an occluder was used to decrease vision in the dominant eye to determine at which point ocular dominance switched to the other eye. Results: Twenty subjects were classified as having strong ocular dominance, based on consistent results on all 3 tests of ocular dominance. The other 10 subjects were classified as having weak ocular dominance based on inconsistent results on the 3 tests. The visual acuity at which ocular dominance switched was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the strong-dominant group compared with the weak-dominant group for each method of determining dominance and was most significantly lower for method (2) and least significantly lower for method (3). Conclusions: Which of a subject's eyes is dominant can be estimated using 3 tests of ocular dominance. The degree of ocular dominance can be estimated quantitatively from how much the visual acuity must be decreased before ocular dominance switches."

"Kancler David E.; Quill Laurie L.";0.0;Ocular dominance effects on the application of monocular, occluding head-mounted displays;1997;Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society;0;"This study investigates the effects of ocular dominance when maintenance procedures are presented on a monocular, occluding head-mounted display (HMD). While previous research has not revealed significant effects associated with ocular dominance and the use of a monocular, occluding HMD, most of this research has occurred in the cockpit environment. By nature, this setting involves continually changing (or dynamic) environmental information, such as target location or altitude. By contrast, the aircraft maintenance environment is static; the technician is not required to process dynamic environmental information. As the Air Force studies the feasibility of presenting maintenance procedures on HMDs, research efforts must thoroughly address questions pertaining to the use of these devices, such as potential effects of ocular dominance. The current study addresses the effect of ocular dominance on performance times, subjective workload ratings, self reports, and preference rankings. Consistent with previous research, ocular dominance did not have a significant effect on any of the dependent measures. However, order of presentation (dominant eye before non-dominant eye vs. dominant eye after non-dominant eye) did provide some differences in performance times and workload scores. Explanations for these differences are discussed."

Subjects were tested when performing single (Experiment 1) and reciprocal (Experiment 2) aiming movements under different vision conditions (full vision, 20 ms on/180 ms off, 10/90, 40/160, 20/80, 60/120, 20/40). Although in both experiments right hand advantages were found, manual asymmetries did not interact with intermittent vision conditions. Similar patterns of results were found across vision conditions for both hands. These data do not support the visual feedback processing hypothesis of manual asymmetry. Motor performance is affected to the same extent for both hand systems when vision is degraded.

Methods: Accommodative stimulation was done with a LED bar. The stimuli were presented monocularly in a stepwise and a sinusoidal mode to either the dominant or the non-dominant eye with the other eye covered. The neck proprioceptors were activated by vibration on the neck muscles which turn the head horizontally. Eye movements were recorded with an infra-red reflection system in both eyes. Results: Vibration of the neck muscles shortened the time constant of the accommodative vergence movement in the covered eye to square wave stimulation when the non-dominant eye was fixating the targets. The gain factor to sine wave stimulation was higher when the non-dominant eye was fixating. Conclusion: Extraretinal signals from neck proprioception influenced not only the static eye position, but also the dynamics of monocularly driven accommodative vergence movements, when the non-dominant eye was the viewing eye.

Both parameters can be utilised for the correct identification of the stimulated hemiretina in healthy volunteers (Hoffmann, K. et al. Electroenceph. clin. Neurophysiol, 100, 1996: 569-578). The aim of this study was the investigation of the robustness of instantaneous frequency for reduced numbers of averages. Hemifield PVEP of 15 volunteers (20 channel records) were analysed. The number of averages was reduced step-by-step (64-32-16-8- 4-1). For each average, the time of P100 latency was determined by the Global field power maximum between 90 and 125 ms. The stimulated hemifield was identified using the potential or instantaneous frequency values at the occipital electrode positions O1 and O2: by maximal potential and instantaneous frequency on the stimulus-contralateral side. In summary, by reduced numbers of averages (as well as by single trials) the stimulated hemiretina was correctly identified more frequently on the basis of instantaneous frequency than of potential distribution. A number of 8 averages seems to be sufficient for the correct identification of the stimulus condition. Consequently, for the identification of left and right hemifield stimulations the recording time could be reduced immensely. Instantaneous frequency is suggested as an additional and robust parameter for the selective averaging of artefact-free trials during the recording of hemifield PVEP.

Vis. Sci. 84, 521-526), we investigated the effect of small prescription errors on spatial visual performance and spectacle lens acceptability. We included both negative and positive errors and binocular and monocular errors. Data were collected on 15 young adult subjects. Clinical measures were taken of pupil size, ocular dominance, binocular visual acuity, negative and positive relative accommodation, distance and near heterophorias, and stereopsis. Visual performance was measured with the best correction and for ±0.50 D spherical binocular and monocular errors. Subjects wore spectacles, each containing a different error in turn, for 2 days and compared them with a reference pair. Following the wearing period subjects assessed the performance of the spectacles by completing a short questionnaire. The only ocular tests for which these small prescription errors had significant effects were binocular visual acuity and negative relative accommodation. No significant relationship was observed between any of the clinical test results and overall lens acceptance. Despite this, the reference pair was generally perceived as better than the test pairs containing errors, and a considerable proportion of subjects reported pairs with errors as being unacceptable. In conclusion, the questionnaire findings support the need for both accurate monocular and binocular refractions. Subjects differed in their criteria for judging lens acceptability.

Compared to right-handers, left-handers with less pronounced left-hand preferences (Subgroup B) showed higher values in intermanual coordination and lower values in finger-tapping asymmetry. Moreover, familial sinistrality and eyedness interacted with handedness effects. While in right-handers intermanual coordination was significantly higher in subjects with dominant left eye, in left-handers of the Subgroup B it was somewhat higher in those with dominant right eye. Higher values in intermanual coordination and reduced asymmetry in finger tapping may be associated with a greater bihemispheric control and better performance in fast bimanual movements.
"Sobel K.V.; Blake R.";0.0;Does context influence a rival target's escape from suppression?;2001;Journal of Vision;10.1167/1.3.173;"Purpose. Does binocular rivalry, the alternation in perceptual dominance associated with viewing incompatible monocular images, result from a single, omnibus process? As a point of departure for answering this question, we note that dominance phases among neighboring rival targets may covary when those targets imply global spatial structure, via common color, orientation, or motion. Local zones of rivalry seem to interact spatially to promote grouping and, therefore, global dominance. In our experiments, the global context outside of the region of rivalry was changed during rivalry, to learn whether contextual information alters the ability to detect changes in a suppressed target itself. Methods. One eye viewed an array of disks that appeared to be dimples because of implied shading. One member of this array was engaged in rivalry with a dissimilar target presented to the other eye. While suppressed, the rival dimple reversed contrast polarity on some trials but not on others, and the context dimples were sometimes reversed and sometimes not. Results. Reversals were detected only when they occurred rather abruptly; more gradual reversals went undetected. Contrary to expectation, contrast reversals outside the zone of rivalry did not enhance the ability to detect changes within the rivalry zone, but rather interfered. Evidently, the fate of the suppressed stimulus is determined by neural events distinct from those responsible for global organization during dominance. To reconcile diverse findings concerning rivalry, it may be important to distinguish between processes responsible for selection of one eye's input for dominance from processes responsible for the implementation and maintenance of suppression."
"Dannemiller J.L.; Stephens B.R.";0.0;Asymmetries in contrast polarity processing in young human infants;2001;Journal of Vision;10.1167/1.2.5;Luminance increments and decrements of equal magnitude are processed asymmetrically in the adult visual system. At detection threshold, decrements are slightly easier to detect than increments. At suprathreshold contrast levels decrements appear to have more contrast than increments when both differ from the background by the same absolute amount. Two experiments are reported with 3.5-month-old human infants examining the processing of luminance increments and decrements. Using two different methods to measure the relative salience of positive and negative polarity high contrast bars, we found consistent evidence that dark bars appeared more salient to infants than light bars when both differed from the background by the same absolute amount. The asymmetry may be explained by noting that when luminance increments and decrements have the same Weber contrast, the decrements will have greater Michelson contrast. Perceived contrast in adults follows Michelson contrast more closely than Weber contrast, and a similar metric may characterize the relations between negative and positive contrasts in young human infants. © 2001 ARVO.
Carey D.P.;0.0;Vision research: Losing sight of eye dominance;2001;Current Biology;10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00496-1;Most people prefer to use their right eye for viewing. New evidence reveals that this dominance is much more plastic than that for one hand or foot: it changes from one eye to the other depending on angle of gaze. Remarkably, sighting dominance depends on the hand being directed towards the visual target.
"LaFleur T.; Draper M.H.; Ruff H.A.";0.0;Evaluation of eye-dominance effects on target-acquisition tasks using a head-coupled monocular HMD;2001;Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society;0;Monocular head-mounted displays (HMDs) require operators to place an eyepiece over only one of their eyes, raising the potential for eye-dominance performance differences. This issue is likely to be magnified when the task at hand requires frequent shifts of visual attention from head-coupled imagery to a fixed-CRT display. A study was conducted to determine the effects of eye dominance on a dual-display target-search task. Eight participants determined the presence/absence of a target amongst several decoys while using a head-coupled, see-through, monocular HMD in combination with a fixed-CRT display. Performance data did not reveal any significant eye-dominance effects. Additionally, there were no significant effects on participants' subjective preference between dominant and non-dominant eye for this task. Finally, it took significantly more time to determine that a target was not present than to identify a target that was present. However, there was a trend for female subjects to search longer before concluding that a target was absent.
"Grünbauer W.M.; Dieterich M.; Brandt T.";0.0;Bilateral vestibular failure impairs visual motion perception even with the head still;1998;NeuroReport;10.1097/00001756-199806010-00025;Visual motion perception of a single object, moving with a constant angular velocity of 40 min of arc/s in four orthogonal directions, was measured in eight patients with chronic bilateral vestibular failure (BVF) with the head stationary. Perception of object motion was more severely impaired for horizontal than for vertical directions and the impairment was more pronounced in the dominant eye than the nondominant eye. Impaired motion perception in patients with BVF is best explained by a central visual mechanism that suppresses oscillopsia due to the involuntary retinal slip caused by the defective vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). This mechanism cannot be switched off with the head stationary (inactive VOR) and thus causes a measurable deficit of motion perception.
"Fine E.M.; Rubin G.S.";0.0;Reading with simulated scotomas: Attending to the right is better than attending to the left;1999;Vision Research;10.1016/S0042-6989(98)00208-9;Persons with central field loss must learn to read using eccentric retina. To do this, most adopt a preferred retinal locus (PRL), which substitutes for the fovea. Patients who have central field loss due to age- related macular degeneration (AMD), most often adopt PRL adjacent to and to the left of their scotoma in visual field space. It has been hypothesized that this arrangement of PRL and scotoma would benefit reading. We tested this hypothesis by asking normally-sighted subjects to read with the left or right half of their visual field plus 3.2°in the contralateral field masked from view. Letter identification, word identification, and reading were all slower when only the information in the left visual field was available. This was primarily due to the number of saccades required to successfully read the stimuli. These data imply that patients would be better off with PRL to the right of their scotoma than to the left for the purposes of reading.
Capozzoli N.J.;0.0;Why do we speak with the left hemisphere?;1999;Medical Hypotheses;10.1054/mehy.1999.0004;Human language tends to be associated with circuitry in the left cerebral hemisphere, regardless of individual hand dominance. This may have resulted from the coevolution of language and dexterous manipulation, specifically the use of the dominant hand to direct forces and point to objects in the environment. Asymmetric manipulation of physical objects reflects a fundamental asymmetry of perceptual-motor brain circuitry, which in turn results from the nature of the mechanical interaction between the organism and its environment. The natural selection of more effective manipulative ability, especially in the form of tool use, strengthened the fundamental organismal asymmetry, leading to distinct handedness and hemispheric dominance for manipulation and language in humans. The related subject of ocular dominance is also discussed.

Eye dominance was determined using three tests: Porta, Hole, Point tests. Natural head posture was evaluated using the Arthrodial protractor. Mandibular frenum deviation was recorded as left, right or no deviation. Fifty female subjects were included in the study, 25 TMJ patients attending the Gelb Craniomandibular Pain Center and 25 non-TMJ control subjects. The findings indicate that eye dominance and direction of head rotation are strongly associated in both TMJ and control subjects. Further, in TMJ subjects mandibular deviation occurred in greater frequency than in controls and tends to occur in the contra lateral direction of head rotation.

The results are as follows. 1) Seven traits all show right dominance (RD) in Mongol. However, just arm folding of the seven traits shows left dominance (LD) in Oroqen and Ewenki. In addition, LD also present for hand clasping in Daur, and for hand clasping and stride type in Han. 2) Sexual characteristics are not obvious in the traits. 3) Significant ethnic characteristics are observed in stride type, preferential foot, and preferential eye. 4) Some relationships occur in the traits. Furthermore, leg folding has the mostly close correlation with other six traits, followed by between hand clasping and handedness, and, in the last place, preferential eye with other six traits. 5) From PCA and cluster analysis, it is shown that, compared with Oroqen that has relatively distinct distribution of RD and LD for most of the traits, Ewenki shows the most similar to Mongol, and the more to Daur and Han in the distributing pattern. On the whole, the result coincides with the known history data of ethnic origin of each population.
Greenbaum S.;0.0;Monovision pseudophakia;2002;Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery;10.1016/S0886-3350(02)01218-X;"Purpose: To evaluate distance and near binocular visual acuities and patient acceptability after sequential posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) implantation for pseudophakic monovision correction. Setting: Private practice and the Manhattan Eye Ear and Throat Hospital, New York, New York, USA. Methods: This study comprised 140 binocular patients with less than 2.00 diopters (D) of astigmatism. Preoperatively, all patients expressed a desire to be independent of optical correction; 120 presented for removal of visually significant cataract and 20, for correction of high ametropia (+8.00 to -14.00 D). Phacoemulsification and implantation of a PC IOL calculated to achieve emmetropia were performed in the dominant eye. Ocular dominance was confirmed on multiple preoperative visits using a sighting technique. Implantation of a PC IOL calculated to yield a spherical equivalent of -2.75 D was performed in the nondominant eye. Seven postoperative examinations were performed during the 1-year follow-up, with 96 patients completing all evaluations. At each examination, interviews were conducted on patient acceptance and ability to perform near and distance tasks without correction. Results: In the entire study group, 129 patients (92%) achieved 20/30 or better uncorrected distance acuity, J1 or better uncorrected near acuity, or both. One hundred ten patients (91%) in the cataract group and 19 (95%) in the clear lens group achieved this level. Patient acceptance was 90% in the cataract group and 100% in the clear lens group. Conclusions: In a diverse group of self-selected patients from 1 metropolitan-area ophthalmology practice who were motivated to be free of spectacles, pseudophakic monovision provided a high level of satisfaction. No morbidity was associated with monovision as those who were dissatisfied with their uncorrected state did well with spectacle or contact lens correction. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The suggestion that findings for eyedness in families are incompatible with genetic theories of handedness (Reiss & Reiss, 1997) is correct for the McManus theory but false for the Annett theory.

"Kelly S.L.; Buckingham T.J.";0.0;Movement hyperacuity in childhood amblyopia;1998;British Journal of Ophthalmology;10.1136/bjo.82.9.991;"Background. Amblyopia results in deficits in a number of visual functions in both the amblyopic and dominant eye. The present work describes oscillatory movement displacement thresholds (OMDT) in childhood amblyopia. Methods. The OMDT from the dominant and amblyopic eyes of 50 orthoptic patients (aged 74 (SD 16) months) were compared with those from a group of 24 controls (79 (21) months). OMDT were measured using a forced choice staircase procedure. Subjects were asked to identify which of the computer controlled monitors displayed the oscillating stimulus. Visual acuity and stereoscopic responses were noted from clinical records. Results. Amblyopic children demonstrating stereopsis showed no significant OMDT deficit in the amblyopic eye. Those children having no stereopsis had elevated OMDT in the amblyopic eye (p < 0.05). Results suggest that the dominant eye of children with amblyopia may also have a pattern of visual development which is anomalous (difference in correlation coefficient with age; p < 0.05). Conclusion. OMDT deficits demonstrated in some amblyopic eyes indicate that amblyopia is incompletely described by its 'clinical' definition. Results suggest that the dominant eye in those with unilateral amblyopia may not be 'normal'."

The aim here was to compare linear and angular tooth crown asymmetries of the permanent molars in healthy right-handed and left-handed subjects. The material comprised 27 children with recorded concordant left-side dominance of hand, eye and foot. The controls were an age- and sex-matched group with right side dominance. The material is based on the Collaborative Perinatal Project where detailed medical records and the dentitions, including accurate dental impressions, of over two thousand American children were examined in the USA in the sixties. Machine vision technique was used to obtain accurate three-dimensional information from the occlusal surfaces of the first permanent upper and lower molars. The directional asymmetry values of angular measurements of mandibular first molars showed evidence of asymmetry of opposite direction between the two examined groups. The results indicate that occlusal morphology of first permanent molars may be affected by handedness, and this tendency is most evident in the angular measurements of the mandibular molars. Fluctuating asymmetry did not differ significantly between the examined groups.
"Calloway S.L.; Lloyd I.C.; Henson D.B.";0.0;A clinical evaluation of random dot stereoacuity cards in infants;2001;Eye;10.1038/eye.2001.198;Purpose. To clinically evaluate the random dot stereoacuity cards developed by Birch and Salomao on a population of infants within the first 12 months of life and to generate baseline normative data. Methods. Random dot stereoacuity cards were constructed using vectographic vertical bar stimuli with cross disparities ranging from 45 to 1735 seconds of arc (1.65 to 3.2 log seconds of arc). Wearing polarising goggles, infants were assessed using a two-alternative forced choice preferential looking staircase procedure. Success rate and stereoacuity values for performance as a function of age were evaluated. Results One hundred and seventy-seven tests were completed on 41 infants with ages ranging from 5 to 56 weeks. The random dot stereoacuity procedure was successful in 128 (72.3%) infants, success being dependent upon age. At 0-8 weeks of age, none of the infants produced a fixation preferance towards even the coarsest stereogram. The success rate increased to 50% at 9-16 weeks, 97% at 17-24 weeks, 93% at 25-36 weeks, dropping to 69% at 37-56 weeks due to increasing intolerance to the goggles. Stereopsis was not demonstrable in infants under 8 weeks of age. By 9-16 weeks the mean stereoacuity level was 2.91 log seconds of arc, further increasing to 2.53 at 17-24 weeks, reducing slightly to 2.65 at 25-36 weeks. At 37-56 weeks the mean stereoacuity value was recorded as 2.53 log seconds of arc. Conclusion. Our results indicate that the infant random dot stereoacuity cards provide a simple, quick and portable test for the clinical assessment of stereopsis in infants aged between 17 and 36 weeks, and should prove to be a useful clinical tool to monitor infants at risk of binocular vision disorders.

The differential responses to left or right eye stimulation could be reliably resolved in anatomically well-defined sections of V1. The orientation and width (∼1 mm) of mapped ODC stripes conformed to those previously revealed in postmortem brains stained with cytochrome oxidase. In addition, we showed that mapped ODC patterns could be largely reproduced in different experiments conducted within the same experimental session or over different sessions. Our results demonstrate that high-field fMRI can be used for studying the functions of human brains at columnar spatial resolution.

Forty percent of the children showed left-eyedness. Eyedness was associated with handedness and not significantly related to age group or sex. A strong relationship between the answers of the two parents concerning eye preference was observed. Two hundred forty-four children were followed-up for 2 years. The examinations were carried out once every 6 months. Two thirds of the children showed perfect stability in eye dominance. There was some evidence that stability in eye use tends to increase with age and to be lower in left-handed children with left-handed parents. There is, at present, very little evidence of a positive association between eye dominance in parents and that in their children.

The traditional test however harbors possible confounding variables including individual variance in reaction time, visual acuity, verbal skills and oculomotor function. We have designed a test procedure to control these variables. METHODS: Children were evaluated vith a traditional accommothtive facility test a test which evaluated reaction time and language skill but without accommodative (piano lenses) and a test which evaluated reaction time, language skill and accommodative facility (+/-2.00 D lenses). RESULTS: Speed of reaction time was 2.9 sec/cycle for the piano lenses (for dominant eye). Speed of reaction with +/-2.00 D lenses was 6.6 sec/cycle for dominant eye and the monocular speed of accommodation was calculated to average 3.7 sec/cycle. Normative data reported in the literature was calculated to be 5.5 sec/cycle. DISCUSSION: We found that both our method which controls for confounding variables the traditional method reveal similar findings but that individual subjects would pass one method and fail the other. This is attributed to variation in the reaction time and digit naming skill. CONCLUSIONS: Although both methods reap similar results, both methods should be employed to discover, in those who score below the expected finding, to tease out whether or not the fault falls within the reaction time/language area or whether it is a irue accommodative facility dysfunction. © 1998 SPIE.

Wade N.J.;0.0;Early studies of eye dominances;1998;Laterality;10.1080/713754296;Early accounts of eye dominances are considered. An index of sighting dominance (eye closure) was described by Aristotle, and Porta (1593) introduced an alignment test for it. Porta also described rivalry dominance, and asserted that it favoured the right eye. Acuity dominance, on the other hand, was assigned to the left eye by Borelli (1673). These views are placed in the context of prevailing theories of binocular vision.

Here we focus on two cues providing no absolute spatial reference: optic flow and vestibular cues. We asked whether: (a) both visual and vestibular information are stored and can be reproduced later; and (b) if those modalities are integrated into one coherent percept or if the memory is modality specific. We used a VR setup including a motion simulator (Stewart platform) and a head-mounted display for presenting vestibular and visual stimuli, respectively. Subjects followed an invisible randomly generated path including heading changes between 8.5 and 17 degrees. Heading deviations from this path were presented as vestibular roll rotation. Hence the path was solely defined by vestibular (and proprioceptive) information. The subjects' task was to continuously adjust the roll axis of the platform to level position. They controlled their heading with a joystick and thereby maintained an upright position. After successfully following a vestibularly defined path twice, subjects were asked to reproduce it from memory. During the reproduction phase, the gain between the joystick control and the resulting visual and vestibular turns were independently varied. Subjects learned and memorized curves of the vestibularly defined virtual path and were able to reproduce the amplitudes of the turns. This demonstrates that vestibular signals can be used for spatial orientation in virtual reality. Since the modality with the bigger gain factor had a dominant effect on the reproduced turns, the integration of visual and vestibular information seems to follow a ""max rule"", in which the larger signal is responsible for the perceived and memorized heading change."

Results from studies of visual preference, object examination, conditioned leg-kicking, sequential touching, and generalized imitation reveal different patterns of category formation, with different levels of exclusivity in the category representations formed by infants at different ages. We suggest that differences in levels of exclusivity reflect the degree to which the various tasks specify the relevant category distinction to be drawn by the infant. Performance in any given task might reflect prior learning or within-task learning, or both. The extent to which either form of learning is deployed could be determined by task context.

This experiment reveals that the eye through which stimuli are viewed also exerts a modulating influence on spatial attention, as indexed by significant alterations in the magnitude of pseudoneglect. Using a forced-choice tachistoscopic line bisection protocol, 24 participants (12 male; 12 female) bisected horizontally oriented lines (22.6° w × 0.39° h) presented to central vision in 3 conditions: left uniocular viewing (L), right uniocular viewing (R), and binocular viewing (B). Perceived line midpoint, a measure of bisection accuracy, deviated significantly leftward of veridical (p < .05) in all viewing conditions, confirming a tonic asymmetry of visuospatial attention in normal young observers. In addition, a significant influence of viewing condition was found (p < .05) where pseudoneglect was greatest in the L condition, followed by the B and R conditions, respectively. Analysis of the slopes of the psychometric functions revealed significantly greater bisection precision in the binocular versus uniocular viewing conditions (p < .05). The results are interpreted to suggest that phasic effects on spatial attention can be produced by uniocular viewing via asymmetric retinotectal projections. The results are consistent with activation - orientation theories of attentional asymmetry."

We hypothesized that this bias is attributable to learning derived from traffic rules that specify driving on the right side of the road and that it also could be related to handedness. We tested participants in both the United States and England in a simple ""T-maze"" task in order to compare their directional preference. Handedness was the best predictor of participants' directional preference. However, U.S. participants also were statistically more likely to turn right than were English participants. The preference to turn right was not found to be significantly related to eye dominance or reading direction of the primary written language of the participant, although in the case of reading direction, the sample size of right-to-left readers was too small to be conclusive. The findings support that walking direction preference is an additive function of both learned driving patterns and genetic handedness. These findings have practical implications for the design of public spaces such as schools, businesses, and urban centers."

Sarcospan is a member of the dystrophin associated protein complex in skeletal and extraocular muscle and maps to human chromosome 12p11.2. Mutations in the genes encoding each of the other components of the skeletal muscle sarcospan-sarcoglycan complex (α - δ sarcoglycan) have been shown to cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2C-F). To determine whether mutations in the sarcospan gene are responsible for CFEOM1 we: (1) attempted to map sarcospan to the CFEOM1 critical region; (2) developed a genomic primer set to directly sequence the sarcospan gene in CFEOM1 patients; and (3) generated an anti-sarcospan antibody to examine extraocular muscle biopsies from CFEOM1 patients. Results: When tested by polymerase chain reaction, sarcospan sequence was not detected on yeast or bacterial artificial chromosomes from the CFEOM1 critical region. Sequencing of the sarcospan gene in CFEOM1 patients from 6 families revealed no mutations. Immunohistochemical studies of CFEOM1 extraocular muscles showed normal levels of sarcospan at the membrane. Finally, sarcospan was electronically mapped to bacterial artificial chromosomes that are considered to be outside of the CFEOM1 critical region. Conclusions: In this report we evaluate sarcospan as a candidate gene for CFEOM1. We have found that it is highly unlikely that sarcospan is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. As of yet no sarcospan gene mutations have been found to cause muscular abnormalities. © 2001 O'Brien et al, licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Annett M.;0.0;Predicting combinations of left and right asymmetries;2000;Cortex;10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70534-3;"This paper explains how combinations of asymmetries for pairs of laterality variables may be predicted. It shows that many pairs combine as expected by chance, plus the influence of the RS+ gene hypothesised by Annett (1978, 1985). These include: eye dominance with writing hand, with throwing hand, and with foot for kicking; nonright handedness with planum temporale asymmetry, with asymmetry of the parietal operculum, and the association between these two anatomical asymmetries. Handedness for writing and throwing, and hand and foot preferences are more strongly associated, suggesting the presence of an additional influence. The reliability of the present analyses was supported by replication, especially in findings for hand preferences for writing and throwing described by Gilbert and Wysocki (1992). The relative frequencies of discordant patterns of preference, LR (writing, throwing) versus RL, are a function of the frequencies of the two variables in the population. These differ between age groups and also with the classification of 'either' hand preferences. Patterns of preference for writing, throwing and eye-dominance (RRR, RRL etc) are related in an orderly manner to differences between the hands for peg moving time. The success of the present application of the RS theory strengthens the argument that individual differences for hand preference depend on a continuous distribution of asymmetry, not on the 'types' commonly assumed in the literature."

The relation between handedness and the eyes and vision (ocular sighting dominance) has been a focal point despite their physiologic dissimilarity. Study: To examine a college varsity baseball team for handedness and ocular sighting dominance to determine if their patterns of eye-hand dominance differed from the normal population and/or contributed to their individual relative success compared to their peers. Specifically: whether crossed eye- hand dominance favors the batter and uncrossed eye-hand dominance favors the pitcher. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty five UF varsity players were examined. All were male. Their visual acuity, stereoscopic vision, ocular motility and ocular sighting dominance were determined, the last by a pointing test which allowed the diagnosis of a central form of ocular dominance, but was not per se affected by handedness. Handedness was determined by preferred arm for throwing or hitting. No subject was ambidextrous. A control population was established consisting of the first 100 consecutive adults seen by the first author in the UF Eye Center with 20/20 vision O.U. and a normal eye exam. RESULTS: The control group displayed eye-hand dominance patterns similar to those previously reported in the literature for the general population. In the experimental group of baseball players, the incidence of conventionally predominant (in normals) ipsilateral or uncrossed eye-hand dominance was much lower (39%) than the normal control population (65%). The incidence of contralateral or crossed eye- hand dominance was 35%, twice that of the normal control population (18%) (p<0.01). The incidence of central ocular dominance with right or left handedness was 26% or 50% higher than a normal control population (17%) (p<0.25). With regard to individual performance, those players with central ocular dominance, whether right or left handed, were the most successful players in both pitching and batting. Pitchers who were uncrossed eye-hand dominant were distinctly more successful than crossed. Batters who were crossed eye-hand dominant were slightly more successful than uncrossed. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of eye-hand dominance appears related to athletic proficiency for baseball. Warning: Note well: This information may be useful in career guidance but does not justify or medically indicate attempts to alter ocular sighting dominance or eye-hand dominance patterns as these are determined probably genetically or at such an early age that they cannot be successfully altered later. Attempts to so alter them are historically fraught with irremediable psychological or physical injury to the subject, including permanent incapacitating double vision.

This technique is based on observations that a high level of perceived stereoscopic image quality can be maintained when the quality of the video stream to one eye is reduced. To address issues surrounding eye dominance and viewing comfort, we proposed to balance the inputs to the two eyes by cross-switching the image quality in the two streams over time. Here, we report two experiments on the visibility of cross-switches, for video sequences and random-dot stereograms. In both experiments, we manipulated (a) the degree of asymmetry in quality of the video streams by varying image blur, and (b) the timing of the cross-switch (either at a scene-cut or during a continuous scene). The viewers' task was to indicate whether the first or the second of a pair of stereoscopic presentations contained a cross-switch. We found that the cross-switch was masked by a scene cut, and that ease of detection depended on the degree of asymmetrical blur. We conclude that asymmetrical coding combined with cross-switching at scene cuts is a practical bandwidth-reduction technique for stereoscopic video.
Zhang F.;0.0;A clinical analysis of 25 cases with Duane's retraction syndrome combined with congenital crocodile tears;2002;[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology;0;OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical manifestations of Duane's retraction syndrome (DRS) combined with congenital crocodile tears or gustatory-lacrimal reflex. METHODS: Twenty-five cases of DRS associated with congenital crocodile tears were retrospectively summarized. The clinical features, including sex, age at first visit, chief complaints, laterality, types of DRS, features of abnormal lacrimation and its associated ocular and non-ocular anomalies were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 8 males and 17 females with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2. Fifteen cases had binocular involvement and the remaining 10 cases were monocular involvement. In general, the association of the abnormal lacrimation and eye movement disorder in unilateral cases was ipsilateral, while in bilateral cases the abnormal lacrimation and the movement disorder were also bilateral except 3 cases of bilateral DRS with monocular crocodile tears and one case of unilateral DRS with binocular crocodile tears. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, cases with Duane's syndrome combined with crocodile tears are relatively few. That sufficiently pay attention to and master its clinical characteristics is the basis for its correct diagnosis.

During standard automated perimetry (SAP), some patients experience visual disturbances in the tested eye while the other eye is covered with an opaque occluder. It is possible that a binocular interaction producing an inhibitory response in the nonoccluded eye, such as rivalry or Ganzfeld blankout, may be the causative factor, particularly when the dominant eye is occluded. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether subjective visual disturbances occurring during conventional perimetric test conditions were related to ocular dominance and to investigate the effect of these disturbances on measurements made during threshold visual field analysis. Method. Ocular dominance was determined by questioning and objective testing on 55 normal subjects. Each subject underwent program 24-2 Full Threshold SAP on a Humphrey Field Analyzer, and an opaque black patch was used to occlude the nontested eye. After testing, patients were asked to report symptoms of visual disturbance characteristic of rivalry or blankout, and the relationship between ocular dominance and visual disturbances was investigated. To determine whether symptoms of rivalry or blankout had affected visual field quantification, comparisons of short-term fluctuation, mean deviation, and false-negative errors were performed between eyes with and without visual disturbances. Results. A total of 24 of 55 subjects reported visual disturbances consistent with rivalry or blankout (44%). Sixteen subjects complained of the phenomenon in one eye, and eight complained of the phenomenon in both eyes. Of the 16 experiencing disturbances in one eye only, nine cases occurred during occlusion of the dominant eye. The association between ocular dominance and visual disturbances was not found to be significant (p > 0.10). No significant differences in short-term fluctuation (p = 0.78), mean deviation (p = 0.64), or false-negative errors (p = 0.10) were found between eyes with and without visual disturbances. Conclusions. Patients undergoing standard automated perimetry with opaque patch occlusion of the nontested eye often experience visual disturbances consistent with rivalry or blankout, although these disturbances do not cause increased within-test variability or reduced sensitivity as quantified by visual field global indices. In terms of summary visual field indices, ocular dominance does not appear to affect visual field test results.

There is no record of one individual's long-term experience. Present Material.-This paper is a personal account of all 41 episodes of scintillating zigzags that occurred between the ages of 59 and 85. Observations were made on several aspects of the visual event itself-- evolution, pattern, scotoma, coloration, duration, lateralization, etc. The chronological distribution of spells, circumstances of occurrence, time of day, the season, etc were noted. The study was observational in nature. Documentation of this experience could be of value clinically and scientifically. Results.-The spells occurred irregularly, unrelated to season, time of day, activity at onset, diet, and temperamental state. The characteristic appearance was a flickering zigzag line that began centrally and migrated to the periphery. The display, which was stereotyped, was achromatic. The average duration was 15 minutes. Both visual fields were equally involved, never at the same time. The details of the scintillating zigzag line are actually complex and an account of the observations of others and of the author is included here.
"McManus I.C.; Porac C.; Bryden M.P.; Boucher R.";0.0;Eye-dominance, Writing Hand, and Throwing Hand;1999;Laterality;10.1080/713754334;Handedness and eye-dominance are undoubtedly associated statistically, although a previous meta-analysis has found that the precise relationship is difficult to explain, with about 35% of right-handers and 57% of left-handers being left eye dominant. Of particular difficulty to genetic or other models is that the proportions are distributed asymmetrically around 50%. The present study asked whether this complicated pattern of association occurred because, following Peters, it is necessary to divide right-and left-handers into consistent handers (who write and throw with the same hand) and inconsistent handers (who write and throw with opposite hands). In an analysis of 10,635 subjects from questionnaire studies, 28.8% of left-handers and 1.6% of right-handers by writing were inconsistent for throwing. Our results also showed that writing hand and throwing hand both relate independently to eyedness, that throwing hand is somewhat more strongly associated with eyedness, and that the awkward asymmetry around 50% is now removed, 24.2% of consistent right-handers being left eye dominant compared with 72.3% of consistent left-handers, and 55.4% of inconsistent right-handers compared with 47.0% of inconsistent left-handers. We conclude that eyedness is phenotypically secondary to writing and throwing handedness. In our discussion we note that eyedness runs in families, we present new data suggesting that writing hand and throwing hand are co-inherited, and we argue that further data are now required to model properly the associations of writing hand, throwing hand, and eyedness, as well as probably also footedness and language dominance.
"Bonneh Y.; Sagi D.";0.0;Configuration saliency revealed in short duration binocular rivalry;1999;Vision Research;10.1016/S0042-6989(98)00112-6;Supra-threshold spatial integration was studied by testing the saliency of multi-Gabor element configurations in short duration binocular rivalry (dichoptic masking) conditions. Dichoptic presentations allow for a competition between spatially overlapping supra-threshold stimuli that involve non-overlapping monocular receptive fields in the first stage of visual filtering. Different spatial configurations of Gabor patches (σ=λ=0.12°) were presented to one eye (target) together with a bandpass noise presented to the other eye (mask). After a short rivalry period (120 ms) in which a dominance of one eye was established, a probe (a randomly positioned small rectangle of reduced contrast in the target) was presented for additional detection period (80 ms). Probe detection performance was measured (two-alternative-forced choice paradigm (2AFC)) by finding the mask contrast leading to 79% correct response. Results show that configuration saliency is consistently expressed as dominance in short-duration binocular rivalry, with similar results obtained for longer durations (200 ms and continuous presentations). We find that textures of high-contrast randomly oriented patches are more dominant than uniform textures where the effect decreases and eventually reverses with decreasing of contrast. For supra- threshold contours, however, we find that smooth collinear contours are more dominant than 'jagged' ones, regardless of phase and contrast. These findings suggest principles underlying early lateral integration mechanisms based on contrast dependent inhibitory and excitatory connections. This mechanism could be based on iso-orientation surround (2D) inhibition and collinear (1D) facilitation, with inhibition being more effective at high contrasts.

Methods: This study was conducted in 11 normal volunteers (age range, 22-30 years). The subject was seated on a chair, and the head was fixed using a bite-block. The dominant eye was determined with the ""hole-in-the-card"" test. Horizontal positions of the eyes were recorded using an infrared reflection device. Recordings of right eye movements were subtracted from left eye movements to obtain the vergence response. The fixation target was moved toward the center of both eyes from 50 to 20 cm in front of the face at a constant velocity in five steps (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm/s). The target was moved by a pulse motor controlled by a microcomputer. The dynamic properties of each eye movement and the vergence components were analyzed. Results: At velocities ≤40 cm/s, convergence responses consisted of two components: the fusion-initiating component and the fusion-sustaining component. The fusion-initiating component drove the initial faster dynamic portion of the response, and the fusion-sustaining component maintained the latter slower dynamic portion of the response. The mean peak velocity of the fusion-initiating component was significantly greater in the dominant eye than in the nondominant eye. The mean peak latency of the catch-up component was significantly shorter in the dominant eye than in the nondominant eye. Conclusions: The present study indicated that the trajectory of convergence eye movement under natural viewing conditions consists of two components, the fusion-initiating component and the fusion-sustaining component, and that the convergence response to symmetric stimuli was asymmetric between the dominant eye and the nondominant eye during the fusion-initiating phase. The neural control system of convergence eye movements preferentially drives the dominant eye during the fusion-initiating phase of the response. © 2001 Japanese Ophthalmological Society."
"Laing C.R.; Chow C.C.";0.0;A spiking neuron model for binocular rivalry;2002;Journal of Computational Neuroscience;10.1023/A:1014942129705;We present a biologically plausible model of binocular rivalry consisting of a network of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons. Our model accounts for the experimentally and psychophysically observed phenomena: (1) it reproduces the distribution of dominance durations seen in both humans and primates, (2) it exhibits a lack of correlation between lengths of successive dominance durations, (3) variation of stimulus strength to one eye influences only the mean dominance duration of the contralateral eye, not the mean dominance duration of the ipsilateral eye, (4) increasing both stimuli strengths in parallel decreases the mean dominance durations. We have also derived a reduced population rate model from our spiking model from which explicit expressions for the dependence of the dominance durations on input strengths are analytically calculated. We also this reduced model to derive an expression for the distribution of dominance durations seen within an individual.

The desired quality of the fused stereoscopic image can be achieved, provided that binocular vision assigns greater weight to the nondegraded input. A psychophysical matching procedure was used to determine if such over-weighting occurred when the monocular degradation included blur or blocking artifacts. Over-weighting of the nondegraded input occurred for blur, but under-weighting of the nondegraded input occurred for blockiness. Some participants exhibited ocular dominance, but this did not affect the blur results. The authors conclude that blur, but not blockiness, is an acceptable form of monocular degradation.

Application of excess amounts of particular NTs can prevent the segregation process, suggesting that they could be the substance for which geniculocortical afferents compete during development. We have previously presented a model that accounts for normal OD development as well as the prevention of that development with excess NT. The model uses a Hebbian learning rule in combination with competition for a limiting supply of cortical trophic factor to drive OD segregation, without any weight normalization procedures. Subsequent experimental evidence has further suggested that NTs may be causally involved in the competitive process. Application of NT antagonist can prevent OD columns by causing inputs from both eyes to be eliminated, suggesting that NTs may be the substance for which geniculocortical afferents compete. Also, excess NT can mitigate the shift to the open eye normally caused by monocular deprivation (MD). In this article, we show that the current model can account for these subsequent experiments. We show that deprivation of NT causes inputs from both eyes to decay and that excess NT can mitigate the shift to the open eye normally seen with MD. We then present predictions of the model concerning the effects of NT on the length of the critical period during which MD is effective. The model presents a novel mechanism for competition between neural populations inspired by particular biological evidence. It accounts for three specific experimental results, and provides several testable predictions.

Subjects were seated at 1 m in front of a screen where a random-dot pattern was projected and made saccades of 7.5 and 15 deg along the horizontal and vertical principal meridians and to tertiary positions in the upper and lower field. During the training period, compensatory disconjugacy of the amplitude of the saccades occurred for the principal horizontal and vertical meridians; such increased disconjugacy persisted after training, suggesting learning. In contrast, for horizontal saccades to or from tertiary positions made in the upper and lower field, no consistent changes in the disconjugacy occurred, either during training or after the training condition. In an additional experiment, three subjects read sequences of words with the 2% magnifier in front of their dominant eye: in such a task, horizontal saccades to or from tertiary positions at the upper or lower field showed appropriate and lasting disconjugacy for two of the three subjects. We conclude that even a 2% image size inequality stimulates oculomotor learning, leading to persistent disconjugacy of saccades. The small disparity created by the image-size inequality is thus compensated by the oculomotor system rather than tolerated by the sensory system (e.g. by enlarging the Panum's area). © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd."

In recent years, however, rivalry's audience has expanded to include neuroscientists who envision rivalry as a ""tool"" for exploring the neural concomitants of conscious visual awareness and perceptual organization. For rivalry's potential to be realized, workers using this ""tool"" need to know details of this fascinating phenomenon, and providing those details is the purpose of this article. After placing rivalry in a historical context, I summarize major findings concerning the spatial characteristics and the temporal dynamics of rivalry, discuss two major theoretical accounts of rivalry (""eye"" vs ""stimulus"" rivalry) and speculate on possible neural concomitants of binocular rivalry."
Enright J.T.;0.0;On the 'Cyclopean eye': Saccadic asymmetry and the reliability of perceived straight-ahead;1998;Vision Research;10.1016/S0042-6989(97)00173-9;If two targets are both on the visual axis of one eye or the other, and binocular fixation is shifted from the farther one to the nearer, the aligned eye consistently makes an initial, seemingly pointless saccade in a temporal direction. The size of those saccades typically differs markedly, depending on whether the targets are aligned with the observer's dominant or non-dominant eye. Pickwell proposed that this binocular asymmetry in oculomotor performance reflects a subject-specific lateral displacement of the egocenter (the 'binoculus' of Hering, which has traditionally been assumed to be on the midline). An empirical test of Pickwell's widely endorsed hypothesis has now been conducted and the proposal has been found wanting. In an otherwise darkened room, subjects were required repeatedly to set a small light to a perceived straight-ahead location in the horizontal plane, first for a target at 300 cm distance and then for one at 30 cm. Extrapolation of a line that connects the two averages of those settings to the inter-ocular axis provides an estimate of the subjective egocenter to which visual directions are referred. Contrary to Pickwell's proposal, those locations of the inferred egocenter were usually quite near the midline, and were completely uncorrelated with same-subject data on the extent of saccadic asymmetry at the onset of asymmetrical convergence. The data on perceived straight-ahead underlying this result indicate the availability of extraretinal information about eye orientation that is quite precise at a given moment (median standard deviation of 47 min arc) but conspicuously non-stationary over several-minute intervals (monotonic drifts in sequential settings being very common).

It is a biochemical abnormality of methionine metabolism caused either by transulfuration pathway disorders or by disorders of homocysteine remethilation into methionine and as such it can be a result of numerous specific and different genetic lesions. CASE REPORT: Homocystinuria is most commonly caused by deficiency of cystationine beta synthetase enzyme which catalyses the synthesis of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine in the methinione pathway. This results in accumulation of homocysteine and methionine in plasma and leads to excretion of excessive urinary homocysteine. Depending on specific property of the mutant enzyme molecule some patients respond to very high doses of pyridoxine with decreases of methionine and homocystine and some not. Pyridoxine responsiveness is based on the presence of small residual activity of cystathionine beta synthetase which is not present in nonresponsive patients. Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is characterized by numerous different clinical abnormalities, but changes in four organ systems are dominant (eye, skeletal, central nervous and vascular system). CASE DESCRIPTION: Six years ago a six year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with vision problems. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a lens dislocation and because of many stigmates the child was sent to endocrinologist. The child had a marfanoid stature, with pectus carinatum and genu valgum, ataxic gait with motoric discoordination, muscle tone which ranged from hypotonia to hypertonia of extrapvramidal type and low intellectual abilities. A simple cyanide-nitroprusside test of patient's urine was positive suggesting homocystinuria. The diagnosis was established after plasma and urine amino acid analysis by HPLC. Concentration of homocystine and methionine were 52 mumol/l and 57 mumol/l in plasma and 249 mumol/du and 55 mumol/du in urine, respectively. After four months of treatment with pyridoxine there were not any significant changes in plasma homocysteine and methionine, but at the same time decrease in urine of these two amino acids were more than 2.5 times higher. This confirms that the patient has a pyridoxine-responsive type of homocystinuria and the dose was increased to 60 mg/day and 600 mg/day. This results in further decline of homocysteine and methionine in plasma and urine which persists up to now (for six years).

Mixed lateral preference was noted in significantly more PTSD patients than controls (65 v. 43%, P < 0.005). Conclusions. These results indicate a possible hemispheric imbalance (less lateralization) in PTSD patients, with the right hemisphere playing a more active role in perceptual and cognitive processing and in the regulation of biological responses in these patients. This imbalance may be relevant to the pathophysiology of PTSD.

METHODS: This prospective study included 120 eyes of 60 normal volunteers (mean age, 50.0 ± 16.9 years; range, 21 to 77 years). The square blur rate was measured by laser speckle flowgraphy (Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka, Japan). The sequence of eye measurements was randomized. In each eye, measurements were taken at the neuroretinal rim away from visible vessels. Linear regression analysis, paired two-tailed t test, and two-way analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis. P values less than .05 were accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation in square blur rate between the right and left eyes (r = 0.587, P < .001). Square blur rate in the superior temporal neuroretinal rim significantly correlated with that in the inferior temporal neuroretinal rim in each of the right (r = 0.546, P < .001) and left (r = 0.465, P < .001) eyes. Square blur rate in the right eye was higher than that in the left eye (P = .049). Square blur rate in the superior neuroretinal rim was higher than that in the inferior neuroretinal rim in both the right (P = .035) and left (P = .005) eyes. CONCLUSION: There were statistically significant differences of optic nerve head blood flow in normal volunteers using laser speckle flowgraphy between the right and left eyes and between the superior and inferior temporal neuroretinal rims.

The purpose of the present research was to investigate the implications of these studies for interaction between people who are disabled and people who are non-disabled. It was predicted that disability would differentiate the two groups, with non-disabled partners dominating the visual interaction. Two studies are reported. The first looked at visual interaction through the two looking modes of looking while listening and looking while speaking between 16 dyads where one partner was intellectually disabled and the other non-disabled. In the second study, eight subjects who were intellectually disabled and who had participated in the first study interacted with another person who had an intellectual disability. Their looking modes were then compared between conversing with a non-disabled partner in study 1 and with those of their partner with intellectual disability in study 2. The outcome of the studies showed that subjects who were intellectually disabled did not discriminate in looking mode between partners of different intellectual levels. Conversely, subjects who were non-disabled spoke and looked significantly more when conversing with their partner who was intellectually disabled. It has been argued that overlooking and overspeaking could arise from the need for the non-disabled person to gain some sign of affiliation from their partner, or alternatively, that it might reflect a dominant non-disabled person attempting to facilitate a cooperative style.

The subjects' task was to decide, as quickly as possible, whether each of a series of traits (targets) connoted something positive or negative. Before the presentation of each target, a subliminal prime was briefly presented to the non-dominant eye. The prime was masked dichoptically by the simultaneous presentation of a mask to the dominant eye. Three kinds of primes were presented: personality traits (e.g., honest); non-trait words (e.g., gift); and a compound prime made up of two words, a trait and a non-trait word evaluatively opposed to one another in polarization (e.g., sincere and disease). In line with Bower's (1981, 1991) affective network model of memory, the findings indicated (1) that subjects' decision speed of the evaluative target valence was influenced by the connoted content of apparently undetectable personality trait primes and non-trait primes, and (2) that no priming effect occurred for the compound prime condition."
"Arteaga M.; Torre E.; Delgado M.";0.0;The influence of anaerobic physical exertion on dynamic visual acuity and ocular motility;2002;Journal of Human Movement Studies;0;There now seems to be a consensus that the eye is the predominant sense organ which receives information in a sporting activity situation. There is also evidence of the influence of fatigue on a sportsperson's general performance during competition. However, there is little evidence that fatigue has any negative effect on visual function. A sample of 15 volunteers, 5 women and 10 men, aged between 18-35yrs who practised different sports, was selected. Using an intra-subject design, A-(B1-B2)-A, measurements were taken of the parameters of Dynamic Visual Acuity and Ocular Motility in different fatigue conditions to analyse the possible negative effect on the subject's visual capacity. The results prove that fatigue caused by anaerobic physical exertion has no harmful effect on the visual abilities studied.

It generally manifests itself in the teenage years. The gene mutated in VMD-2 patients may provide valuable insight into the biological mechanisms of the far more common disorder age-related macular degeneration. The VMD-2 gene has been localized to 11q13 between UGB and FcεRI. In order to clone the gene positionally, a large Swedish VMD-2 family dating back to the 17th century was studied for recombinations. Since the last study, another 40 microsatellite markers have been analyzed in the family; the closest centromeric flanking marker, D11S4076, revealed two recombinations and the closest telomeric flanking marker, UGB, revealed one recombination. The recombinations have occurred in affected individuals, which eliminates the potential problem of reduced penetrance. The order and physical distance between 22 markers located at proximal 11q13 were analyzed on the G3 Stanford radiation-reduced cell hybrids. The data suggest that the VMD-2 region flanked by the microsatellite markers D11S4076 and UGB is approximately 980 kb."
"Piepenbrock C.; Obermayer K.";0.0;The role of lateral cortical competition in ocular dominance development;1999;Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems;0;"Lateral competition within a layer of neurons sharpens and localizes the response to an input stimulus. Here, we investigate a model for the activity dependent development of ocular dominance maps which allows to vary the degree of lateral competition. For weak competition, it resembles a correlation-based learning model and for strong competition, it becomes a self-organizing map. Thus, in the regime of weak competition the receptive fields are shaped by the second order statistics of the input patterns, whereas in the regime of strong competition, the higher moments and ""features"" of the individual patterns become important. When correlated localized stimuli from two eyes drive the cortical development we find (i) that a topographic map and binocular, localized receptive fields emerge when the degree of competition exceeds a critical value and (ii) that receptive fields exhibit eye dominance beyond a second critical value. For anti-correlated activity between the eyes, the second order statistics drive the system to develop ocular dominance even for weak competition, but no topography emerges. Topography is established only beyond a critical degree of competition."

Recent studies suggest that the disarray / irregular sampling of neurons underlies the spatial distortions which are characteristic of the spatial deficit in strabismic amblyopia '. To quantify these spatial distortions we measured amblyopic subjects' sensitivity for radial frequencies modulations of high contrast circular D4 (4th derivative of Gaussian) patterns. Methods. A 2-interval forced-choice paradigm was employed. One interval contained an unmodulated circular D4 contour and the other contained a modulated circular D4 contour. Subjects' task was to indicate which interval had the modulated contour. The modulation frequencies were 4. 6. 8. or 10 cvc/360e. The D4 oeak soatial frequency was 5 cyc/deg. The mean radius was 0.5 deg. unmodulated modulated The duration of each slimulus presentalion was 0.5 sec. radial treq. - 8 Results. We found the sensitivity of dominant eyes to be similar to that of normal subjects2 and was iti the so called ""hyperacuity"" range (less Ihan 10 arc sec in most cases; for some subjects, below 5 arc sec). Sensitivity for amblyopic eyes was depressed in all subjects and for all stimulus conditions tested. The sensitivity loss (ranging from a faclor of 2-8) increased with increasing radial frequency and was related to the severity of (he amblyopia. Conclusions. Amblyopic subjects show a significant loss of sensitivity for a wide range of radial frequencies consistent with previously hypothesized neural disarray. The site of the neural disarray may occur prior to hypothesized V4 non-Cartesian units thought !o underlie this task ""."

"Westin E.; Wick B.; Harrist R.B.";0.0;Factors influencing success of monovision contact lens fitting: Survey of contact lens diplomates;2000;Optometry;0;"Background: Contact lenses are frequently fitted so that one eye is focused for distance and the other for near (monovision) in order to reduce the dependence of presbyopic patients on bifocal spectacle correction. Methods: We surveyed Diplomates in the Cornea and Contact Lens section of the American Academy of Optometry (N = 179) regarding their estimates of success with monovision fitting and factors influencing their perception of success. Results were statistically analyzed to determine the fitting philosophies of responders estimating that they achieve high success rates (HSRs) and low success rates (LSRs), respectively. Results: Completed surveys were returned by 98 Diplomates (54.8%), who estimated an overall success rate of approximately 71.7% with monovision; 50.5% ""totally successful"" (wear monovision correction full-time without problems or need for additional correction) and 21.2% ""successful"" (wear monovision full-time, but experience some symptoms of blur or other discomfort, may wear over-correction at times for driving or detailed near work). Sighting dominance was the most frequently used method to determine the distant eye, followed by the plus-lens test. The HSR group tended to be more likely to take occupational factors into account when deciding which eye to use for the distance lens, and they used more flexibility in determining the near-add power. The LSR group discontinued monovision sooner than the HSR group, who continued treatment for longer than 4 weeks during the adaptation period much more often for all add ranges. Conclusions: Practitioners who regard monovision treatment as very successful have somewhat different fitting philosophies than those who regard monovision as unsuccessful. Implementation of highly successful practitioners' fitting techniques may increase success with monovision contact lens fitting."

Eglen S.J.;0.0;The role of retinal waves and synaptic normalization in retinogeniculate development;1999;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences;10.1098/rstb.1999.0400;The prenatal development of the cat retinogeniculate pathway is thought to involve activity-dependent mechanisms driven by spontaneous waves of retinal activity. The role of these waves upon the segregation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) into two eye-specific layers and the development of retino-topic mappings have previously been investigated in a computer model. Using this model, we examine three aspects of retinogeniculate development. First, the mapping of visual space across the whole network into projection columns is shown to be similar to the mapping found in the cat. Second, the simplicity of the model allows us to explore how different forms of synaptic normalization affect development. In comparison to most previous models of ocular dominance, we find that subtractive postsynaptic normalization is redundant and divisive presynaptic normalization is sufficient for normal development. Third, the model predicts that the more often one eye generates waves relative to the other eye, the more LGN units will monocularly respond to the more active eye. In the limit when one eye does not generate any waves, that eye totally disconnects from the LGN allowing the non-deprived eye to innervate all of the LGN. Thus, as well as accounting for normal retinogeniculate development, the model also predicts development under abnormal conditions which can be experimentally tested.

In a dark adaptation study, intake of BCA at three dose levels (12.5-, 20-, and 50 mg/subject, n = 12) appeared to bring about dose-dependent lowering of the dark adaptation threshold. Statistical analysis comparing the values before and after intake indicated there was a significant difference at the 50 mg dose (p = 0.011). Comparing the refraction values for the dominant eye, BCA intake (50 mg/subject, n = 21) resulted in no decrease in the average value after the visual task; whereas, a placebo trial resulted in a large decrease in the average value, resulting in borderline significance (p = 0.064).

"Ooi T.L.; He Z.J.";0.0;Sensory eye dominance;2001;Optometry;0;Background: Sensory eye dominance is revealed in tasks like the Red Lens test and binocular rivalry. To understand its neural basis, we used a new protocol based on binocular rivalry to quantify its consequent interocular imbalance. Then we investigated whether the extent or sign of interocular imbalance is correlated with the difference in monocular contrast responses at threshold and suprathreshold and with the observer's motor eye dominance. Methods: To evaluate sensory eye dominance, the stimulus intensity in each eye during rivalry was adjusted to achieve equal predominance. The difference in stimulus intensity constitutes the interocular imbalance. Standard procedures were used to measure monocular spatial contrast sensitivity, suprathreshold brightness judgment, and motor eye dominance. Results: There was no positive correlation between interocular imbalance (sensory eye dominance) and motor eye dominance. No systematic correlation was found between interocular imbalance and monocular contrast sensitivities at 1 and 3 cycles/degree. Correlation coefficient between interocular imbalance and monocular suprathreshold brightness judgment was close to significant, suggesting that a difference in monocular brightness percept might (in part) account for interocular imbalance. But this explanation is only partial, since the difference in the monocular brightness percept was too small to account for the interocular imbalance. Conclusions: Interocular imbalance is a sensory eye dominance that cannot be equated with motor eye dominance. It manifests largely as a binocular phenomenon, which bears little relationship with the monocular neural mechanisms of contrast detection and brightness perception.

The aim of this work is to examine the clinical significance of hand-eye and hand-foot crossed dominance in a sample of 61 right-handed schizophrenic patients. The application of multivariate analysis revealed that 23 right-handed and non-right-eyed patients (crossed hand-eye dominant group) had a significant earlier clinical onset and smaller brain size, global and frontal area, than 38 right-handed and right-eyed schizophrenics (consistent hand-eye dominance group).

We find that stimulus rivalry occurs only within a limited range of spatial and temporal parameters - otherwise eye rivalry dominates.
"Muro E.M.; Andrade M.A.; Morán F.";0.0;A self-organizing model for the development of orientation selectivity and ocular dominance patterns in the visual nervous system;2002;Neural Network World;0;A binocular model for the prenatal development of the visual nervous system is proposed. The model is able to reproduce some properties observed in mammals at the moment of birth such as retinotopy, oriented receptive fields, and ocular dominance. One of the outstanding features of the model architecture is the existence of dendrodendritic interaction within each layer. The spontaneous activity of the neurons of the input layer is modeled by spatially and temporally decorrelated activity. The evolution of a connection depends on the output activity of both connected neurons. Hebbian learning has been used for the afferent excitatory connections and anti-Hebbian learning for the lateral inhibitory connections. The model is reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations obtained from a statistical treatment of the dynamics that avoids its explicit dependence on the spontaneous activity.
"Laeng B.; Rouw R.";0.0;Canonical views of faces and the cerebral hemispheres;2001;Laterality;10.1080/13576500042000115;"Evidence is given for a special, canonical, status of one specific view in the identification of familiar faces. In the first experiment, subjects identified by name the fully frontal or profile poses of briefly familiarised individuals less efficiently than an intermediate pose. In addition, in a matching experiment using faces seen in different poses, it was found that one specific intermediate pose (corresponding to 22.5 degrees of angle from the full frontal view) was matched more efficiently in the right visual field (RVF) than in the left visual field (LVF). This finding supports the hypothesis of a superiority of the left hemisphere (LH) over the right hemisphere (RH) in processing a familiar face's canonical view. The other tested ""non-canonical"" views (i.e., full frontal, 45 degrees, and profile) of these same familiar faces were better matched in the LVF (i.e., the RH); especially at low levels of familiarity. We conclude that, for each familiar face, a viewer-centred representation of the canonical (22.5°) view is stored in the LH's memory system, whereas multiple views of familiar faces are stored in a memory system of the RH. With increasing levels of familiarity other views are increasingly more efficiently encoded by the LH, and in fact for facial self-recognition the full-front view is superior to any of the other tested views. These findings taken together suggest that complementary lateralised memory subsystems in the two cerebral hemispheres store different sets, only partially overlapping, of view-centred face representations."

In this trial, a recent and unique accomplishment was the introduction of the ability to map human brain function non-invasively. Today, functional images with subcentimetre resolution of the entire human brain can be generated in single subjects and in data acquisition times of several minutes using 1.5 tesla (T) MRI scanners that are often used in hospitals for clinical purposes. However, there have been accomplishments beyond this type of imaging using significantly higher magnetic fields such as 4 T. Efforts for developing high magnetic field human brain imaging and functional mapping using MRI (fMRI) were undertaken at about the same time. It has been demonstrated that high magnetic fields result in improved contrast and, more importantly, in elevated sensitivity to capillary level changes coupled to neuronal activity in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast mechanism used in fMRI. These advantages have been used to generate, for example, high resolution functional maps of ocular dominance columns, retinotopy within the small lateral geniculate nucleus, true single-trial fMRI and early negative signal changes in the temporal evolution of the BOLD signal. So far these have not been duplicated or have been observed as significantly weaker effects at much lower field strengths. Some of these high-field advantages and accomplishments are reviewed in this paper.

The free throw shot in basketball was selected as an experimental task. Following a standardised demonstration of the experimental task, each subject was allowed a total of 150 free throws, with 30 throws being taken on each of 5 days, to be familiarised with the ball and the task, prior to his 10 performances measures. The results showed that there were statistically significant differences in free throw shooting accuracy between the ipsilaterally and contralaterally dominant subjects (t=5.805, p<0.0001). Overall, the results of the current study strongly suggest that although other factors may be involved, the pattern of eye-hand preference should be seriously considered as being a significant factor in free throw shooting accuracy in basketball. The implications of these findings for the current pedagogical literature on free throw shooting are discussed.

The static and dynamic visual acuity, ocular muscle balance, ocular dominance, depth perception and colour vision of each of the subjects was measured in addition to their performance on simple and choice reaction time, peripheral response time, rapid tachistoscopic detection, coincidence timing and eye movement skills tasks. Expert superiority was observed on the simple reaction time measure only, and the novices actually outperformed the skilled subjects on a number of the other visual measures (viz., static acuity at near distance, dynamic acuity, vertical ocular muscle balance, choice reaction time and rapid target detection discriminability). Scores on all measures for both groups were within the expected normal range indicating that normal and not necessarily above-average basic visual functioning is sufficient to support skilled clay target shooting. An important implication of the finding that skilled shooters are not characterised by supranormal levels of basic visual functioning is the recognition that any attempt to improve shooting performance through training of general attributes of vision to supranormal levels is likely to be unproductive.

All laterality aspects were assessed quantitatively by using well controlled performance measures instead of questionnaires. The distributions and intercorrelations of the measures as well as their test-retest reliabilities were examined. Results show moderately high reliabilities for all measures, and clearly demonstrate considerable variability among dextrals in the direction and magnitude of the obtained behavioural laterality measures. Most importantly, independence of the different measures questions some common assumptions in laterality research. It seems unlikely, for instance, that handedness and other aspects of laterality may be a product of one single underlying mechanism of brain lateralisation.

While this scheme accounts for many behavioral and neurophysiological observations, it also poses certain problems for manual control. For example, how are these oculocentric representations updated across eye movements, and how are they then transformed into useful commands for accurate movements of the arm relative to the body? Also, since we have two eyes, which is used as the reference point in eye-hand alignment tasks like pointing? We show that patterns of errors in human pointing suggest that early oculocentric representations for arm movement are remapped relative to the gaze direction during each saccade. To then transform these oculocentric representations into useful commands for accurate movements of the arm relative to the body, the brain correctly incorporates the three-dimensional, rotary geometry of the eyes when interpreting retinal images. We also explore the possibility that the eye-hand coordination system uses a strategy like ocular dominance, but switches alignment between the left and right eye in order to maximize eye-hand coordination in the best field of view. Finally, we describe the influence of eye position on eye-hand alignment, and then consider how head orientation influences the linkage between oculocentric visual frames and bodycentric motor frames. These findings are framed in terms of our 'conversion-on-demand' model, which suggests a virtual representation of egocentric space, i.e. one in which only those representations selected for action are put through the complex visuomotor transformations required for interaction with actual objects in personal space.

We present a revision of the technique of visual lateralization of stimuli as one approach to the study of brain asymmetry with regard to language. At the same time, we present a summary of the research carried out by our group using these techniques, reflecting not only the main results but also the most relevant methodological aspects. Development. Brain asymmetry is a basic characteristic of the organization of the nervous system. In most of the principal psychological processes there exists a greater or lesser degree of hemispheric differentiation. Among these, language is possibly one of the processes most noticeably lateralized. One of the main approaches in this field is the study of neurologically normal subjects using techniques of visual lateralization of stimuli. Appropriate use of this technique requires a knowledge of the basic principles involved and of the methodological requirement, as well as the different types of tasks and stimuli, which can be adapted to these requirements. Conclusions. The technique of lateralization of visual stimuli has a long tradition as a procedure for the study of cerebral asymmetry for language and is within the possibilities of most laboratories. However, ensuring correct lateralization requires rigorous controls and this has to be taken into consideration in the selection and adaptation of the experimental paradigm to be used. Several of these paradigms are used in our research and our results provide evidence of the relative character of cerebral asymmetry and of the participation of the right hemisphere in lexico-semantic processing.

The prevalence of left-handedness was found to be only 3.2 percent, i.e. one-third of that (9.6%) observed in a French study using a similar procedure. The degree (weak to strong) but not the direction of hand preference was found to be related to the children's age, with stronger preference among older children. The factor structure of handedness items was similar in France and India. In the second study, 400 schoolchildren from India, aged 6 to 18 years, were examined for handedness, footedness, eyedness, use of hand in space, and absolute and relative hand skill assessed by a peg-moving task and a dot-filling task. Prevalence of left-handedness was 4.2%. A sex difference was observed for handedness, footedness, use of hand in space, and relative hand skill, with higher proportions of right preferences and higher degree of lateralization (i.e., relative between hands asymmetry) in females. The degree of hand skill asymmetry increased with age. These results are discussed in relation to findings from previous studies in other countries using similar procedures.

Both spontaneous and deliberate TUTs were reported during a vigilance task. Left-eye dominance was related to increased childhood hyperactive behaviors and to spontaneous TUTs. of the five groups, subjects diagnosed as ADHD had more spontaneous TUTs and false alarms, whereas those subjects reporting high-activity characteristics as children gave more deliberate TUTs and fewer false alarms, and low-activity subjects responded with the fewest TUTs and false alarms. These results are consistent with the interpretation that in a boring task ADHD children have higher levels of nonconscious processing and poor inhibitory control and that these factors produce greater frequencies of spontaneous intrusive thoughts. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Methods: The ability to hit baseballs in a batting cage was measured under conditions of (1) no filter before either eye, (2) neutral density filters before both eyes, and (3) a neutral density filter before 1 eye, while viewing with both eyes. Batting scores were based on the number of hits, fouls, and misses. Results: A neutral density filter of 0.6 optical density before both eyes had no significant effect on batting ability compared with no filter (87% vs 94%). While viewing binocularly, a filter before 1 eye caused a significantly greater reduction in hitting scores than when the filter was placed before the opposite eye (36% vs 80%). This greater effect of I eye on hitting scores denotes an ocular preference or dominance within the motion stereopsis system. The eye associated with the greater reduction in hitting ability when dimmed by a filter was termed the dominant eye for motion stereopsis. In comparison with placing 0.6-optical density fibers before both eyes, the same filter before the dominant eye reduced hitting ability (36%, vs 87%), but when the filter was placed before the nondominant eye, the hitting ability was not significantly reduced (80% vs 87%). The batting scores decreased as filter densities increased from 0.3- to 0.6-optical density, and the effect was significantly more for the dominant eye than for the nondominant eye. Conclusions: Binocular vision contributes to the precise localization of a pitched baseball, and one eye influences baseball hitting more than the other eye. The motion-in depth channel (baseball hitting) shares a sensitivity to unequal binocular illumination with the sideways-motion channel (Pulfrich phenomenon). The timing of the impulses conducted from the eyes appears to be critical for the precise localization of objects processed by either the motion-in-depth (baseball hitting) or the sideways-motion (Pulfrich phenomenon) channels.

These asymmetries have sometimes been related to sex. With the advent of computerised static perimetry, subtle differences between the left and the right hemifields might be found that were not obvious before. This study investigated differences in retinal sensitivity between the hemifields and the role of sex and eye dominance. Forty three unequivocally right handed and right eye dominant normal adult volunteers, 24 females and 19 males, underwent Humphrey 24-2 testing, half beginning with the left eye, the other half with the right eye. The Peridata program was used to calculate decibel totals per hemifield. Four subjects were excluded because of poor cooperation or test artefacts. In females, the total of the left hemifield was significantly less than the right (p<0.0l) by a mean 18-2 (SD 24) dB equivalent to a difference of 034 dB per tested point. No significant difference in hemifields was found for males, between the sexes for both eyes combined, or between the two eyes for either sex. It was concluded that asymmetries in retinal sensitivity with respect to the vertical axis may be physiological and found in females, but not in males.
Kim H.;0.0;Are subjects' perceptual asymmetries on auditory and visual language tasks correlated?: A meta-analysis;1997;Brain and Language;10.1006/brln.1997.1769;A number of studies have investigated the correlation between subjects' perceptual asymmetries on auditory and visual language tasks. With few exceptions, these studies have found low, nonsignificant correlations between the two types of perceptual asymmetries. However, variations in subjects' perceptual asymmetries on these tasks reflect not only individual differences in language lateralization but also several extraneous variables (e.g., random errors, individual differences in left-right attentional biases). Thus, low correlations between the two types of asymmetries may reflect 'masking' by these extraneous variables rather than a 'true' crossmodal dissociation. Consistent with this view, a meta-analysis of prior studies revealed a small, but significant correlation between the two types of asymmetries for left-handers. The correlation was nonsignificant for right- handers, presumably reflecting stronger attenuation caused by limited variability in language lateralization in this group. Possible factors mediating significant correlations between the two types of perceptual asymmetries include certain language processes shared by the two types of tasks, cross-modal consistency in individual differences in lateralization of certain modality-specific language processes, and cross-modal consistency in individual differences in left-right attentional biases.
"Mansfield J.S.; Legge G.E.";0.0;The binocular computation of visual direction;1996;Vision Research;10.1016/0042-6989(95)00095-H;How is a single visual direction assigned to a binocular feature for which the left and right eyes are signaling different directions? According to geometrical principles, binocular visual direction is the average of the visual directions measured from the left and right eyes. Contrary to this prediction, we have found that the relative visual direction between two Gabor targets presented at different stereoscopic depths could be manipulated by varying the contrast ratio between the left and right images. This finding is consistent with a new model in which the relative alignment of depth features is determined from a maximum-likelihood combination of the direction signals from the left and right eyes. In a second experiment we provide support for this model, showing that the magnitude of the contrast-dependent bias in visual direction is predicted by the uncertainty for spatial localization in the left and right images. Lastly we show that visual direction and stereopsis have different dependencies on interocular contrast differences, suggesting that the computation of stereo depth and visual direction are mediated via different mechanisms.

In the first experiment described here, we compared the effects of applying vibrations to each eye separately and to both eyes simultaneously, under monocular and binocular viewing conditions, in left- and right-eyed subjects. The results confirmed that proprioceptive signals arising from both eyes are involved in egocentric visual localization. A proprioceptive dominance was observed however since vibration of the dominant eye gave rise to larger pointing displacements. In addition, whichever eye was stimulated, the pointing shift induced by vibrating a covered eye was of smaller amplitude than that which occurred when vibrations were applied to the viewing eye. The second experiment showed that both the vibration induced illusions and the pointing shifts disappeared in a structured visual context, which suggests that the processes involved when the target is viewed in darkness might differ from those occurring in structured surroundings. © 1994.

However, the application of these simple Hebbian rules to the development of direction selectivity (DS) is problematic because the best correlated inputs are those that are well correlated in both the preferred and nonpreferred directions of motion. Such afferents would combine to produce non-DS cortical units. Afferents that are in spatiotemporal quadrature would combine to produce DS cortical units, but are poorly correlated in the nonpreferred direction. In this paper, the development of DS is reduced to the problem of associating a pair of units in spatiotemporal quadrature in the face of competition from a third, non-quadrature unit. As expected, simple Hebbian learning rules perform poorly at associating the quadrature pair. However, two additional Hebb-type learning rules, postsynaptic gating and BCM (Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro), improve performance. Results from this three-input model are shown to generalize to a larger network. We conclude that learning rules in which the postsynaptic response determines the magnitude and/or direction of synaptic change perform better than simple Hebbian rules at establishing direction selectivity. © 1997 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Methods: Twenty-nine of 33 subjects (88%) who participated in a 7-week longitudinal study returned for follow-up. The three previous studies had been undertaken at approx. 27 months (study 1), 21 months (study 2) and 9 months (study 3) prior to follow-up. In all three studies, subjects received L-dopa for 7 weeks combined with part-time occlusion of the dominant eye. Five subjects in study 2 received L-dopa without occlusion. Results: Overall, of the subjects who received L-dopa and occlusion, va in the amblyopic eye improved by 1.54 lines during therapy and regressed by 1.28 lines (83%), on average, 13.6 months after therapy. There was a weak, but significant, correlation between gain and regression in the amblyopic eye. Overall, 39% of subjects exhibited worse va at follow-up compared to the respective study baseline. In study 2 subjects who received L-dopa without occlusion, the average gain was 1.68 lines and the regression was 2.08 lines (124%), compared to study 2 subjects who received L-dopa and occlusion who gained 2.1 lines and regressed 1.51 lines (72%). In the study 2 subjects who received only L-dopa, there was a strong correlation between gain and regression (R=-.96, p .005). Conclusions: The results suggest that 9-27 months after therapy, older amblyopic children regress by about 1.5 lines in va in their amblyopic eye. Whether this regression would have occurred regardless of L-dopa therapy and the changes in va in the dominant eye will be discussed.
Mulholland T.B.;0.0;Alpha-contingent stimulation with binocular and monocular viewing;1990;International Journal of Psychophysiology;10.1016/0167-8760(90)90057-K;The method of alpha-contingent stimulation was evaluated under conditions of (1) binocular viewing, (2) monocular viewing, dominant eye, and (3) monocular viewing, non-dominant eye. Twelve normal young adults with normal vision and unequivocal alpha rhythms were tested. There was no evidence against generalizing the alpha contingent stimulation (ACS) method to monocular modes of viewing. The same methodological advantages, e.g. reduced random variability of the latency and duration of alpha blocking, were observed for all modes of viewing, which extends the range of possible applications of ACS method. © 1990.
"Reiss M.; Reiss G.";0.0;Ocular dominance: Some family data;1997;Laterality;10.1080/713754254;The most popular aspect of ocular dominance is sighting dominance or eye preference (eyedness). It refers to the preferential tendency of individuals looking through a telescope, microscope, or keyhole, or sighting along a gun. There is little work on the relative contribution of genetic factors to ocular dominance, so it is useful to review the available data from the literature and to present some new data. Eyedness was examined in a sample of 292 biologically related parent-offspring triads and 36 sibling pairs. The incidence of right eyedness amounted to 66.1%. There was a predominance of right-eyed male subjects over right-eyed female subjects. Analysis of the family study showed a significant correlation between parents and children. The frequency of left eyedness increased continuously with the number of left-eyed parents. These results imply that a genetic influence may operate to affect the direction of eye preference, although the data do not fit any straightforward recessive or dominant Mendelian model. It is possible that they are compatible with the type of model invoking fluctuating asymmetry which has been used to explain the inheritance of other aspects of laterality.

In addition, little attention has been given to the relationship, if any, between eye dominance and fielding and pitching skill. METHODS: A vision screening of 215 professional baseball players in the Southern Baseball League was performed and the eye dominance of these players was determined by a sighting test. Handedness for batting, fielding, and pitching was determined by history. RESULTS: The screening revealed that 66 percent of players were right-eye dominant and that, of 92 players who met the criteria established to qualify for the league batting championship, 60 percent had matched dominance of eye and hand. When official league batting averages were obtained for these 92 players, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference between batters with matched dominance (.278 mean batting average). For the 149 fielders in the league, no statistically significant differences based on eye dominance were found for fielding average (.893 matched dominance, .864 crossed dominance); for the 89 pitchers, a similar result was obtained. Pitchers were also evaluated with respect to eye dominance and earned run average, but no significant difference was found (3.91 matched dominance, 4.03 crossed dominance). CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that there is no association between eye dominance, and hitting, fielding, or pitching skill in baseball."
"Jones 3rd. L.F.; Classe J.G.; Hester M.; Harris K.";0.0;Association between eye dominance and training for rifle marksmanship: a pilot study.;1996;Journal of the American Optometric Association;0;BACKGROUND: This pilot study was performed to determine the effect, if any, exerted by crossed dominance (contralateral hand and eye dominance) on the ability of novice riflemen to learn how to accurately shoot a rifle. METHODS: Sighting dominance was used to determine the dominant eye. Hand dominance was determined by the arm used to shoulder the rifle in the shooting position. Subjects were 308 military recruits at the Fort Benning Army Base in Columbus, Georgia, who had undergone basic training in rifle marksmanship. Qualification scores obtained at the base rifle range were used to measure the subjects' ability to learn marksmanship skills. RESULTS: The subjects with right-hand/right-eye and left-hand/left-eye (uncrossed) dominance had qualification scores that were significantly higher (p = .009) than the subjects with right hand/left-eye and left-hand/right-eye (crossed) dominance. A significantly higher percentage of subjects with uncrossed dominance achieved rifle qualification (86.1 percent) than subjects with crossed dominance (56.5 percent) (p = .000). CONCLUSIONS: The learning of rifle marksmanship is influenced by eye dominance. Individuals who shoot right handed and are left-eye dominant or who shoot left handed and are right-eye dominant do not learn marksmanship skills as readily as individuals who have matched eye and hand dominance. Since crossed hand and eye dominance can be easily determined, it should be possible to identify cross dominant individuals and provide them with special training so that they can perform at a higher level of skill.

Using the same criterion as van Strien, Bouma and Bakker (1987) for defining birth stress, the present study did not replicate their findings of higher frequency of reported birth stress in left-handers. The difference in outcome was ascribed to differences in recruitment of subjects, the present sample constituting a majority of left hand writers from a population of 921 students, while the van Strien sample was less well defined. The present study was extended by comparing left-handed and right-handed subjects (separated for sex) with and without birth stress, on verbal and nonverbal abilities, and on eye dominance, early learning difficulties and familial sinistrality. Left eye dominance was more frequent in male left-handers with birth stress. Birth stress alone had negative effects on cognitive performance, different for males and females. © 1989, Masson Italia Periodici s.r.l. Milano. All rights reserved.
"Ooi T.-L.; He Z.J.";0.0;Popout cue mediated attention can determine binocular rivalry;1996;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;0;"Purpose: The attention theory of binocular rivalry (BR) claims that mediated (transient/bottom-up) attention determines eye dominance. Our previous study (Ooi & He, ARVO 95) supported this view in showing that pre-cueing one eye can make that eye dominant in BR (i.e., the cueing effect). Yet, one may hypothesize that our cueing effect is attributable to the cues' local image properties (luminance contour) rather than the attention induced by the cues. To test this hypothesis, we resorted to the fact that a ""popout"" target draws attention to its location, as a function of the image difference between the popout target and its surrounding elements in the display, and not of its local image property. Methods: Figure: The gray vertical bars (cues) were similar in both eyes, except for one monocular ""popout"" cue (red & horizontal). In a second condition, we switched the color of the popout cue to gray and the surrounding cues to red. According to the attention theory, the popout cue, regardless of its color/luminance, will induce attention to cause the rivalry grating located inside it to be dominant, thus allowing the subject to identify the grating's color. But the local image hypothesis would predict that this same grating will be seen in dominance more often only in the second gray popout cue condition, where its luminance contour is stronger. Results: The cueing effect was observed equally, in both popout cue conditions, indicating that the luminance contour of the cue is irrelevant. Conclusion: Eye dominance in BR is determined by the cue-mediated attention, rather than the local image properties of the cues. Also, our findings suggest that the popout target (cue) induced attention recognizes the eye-of-origin, and asserts its influence on BR, which has been thought to be an early visual process.

"Flitcroft D.I.; Morley J.W.";0.0;Accommodation in binocular contour rivalry;1997;Vision Research;10.1016/S0042-6989(96)00146-0;Although contour rivalry is known to suppress the contribution of the non-dominant eye to some visuomotor mechanisms such as the pupillary light reflex, there have been no reports of the impact of rivalry on accommodation control. In the situation where the accommodation demands in the two eyes are in dynamic conflict, it has been reported that the accommodation response can be modelled in terms of a vector average of the appropriate response in the two eyes. This study compared the binocular interactions in the accommodation system with rivalrous and non-rivalrous stimuli. Accommodation was continuously monitored with an infrared optometer, while the accommodation demand in the two eyes was dynamically modulated independently in the two eyes. When the visual target was perceptually rivalrous the previously described binocular interactions were abolished and the accommodation response closely followed the accommodation demand presented to the dominant eye.

METHODS: A vision screening of 213 professional baseball players in the Southern Baseball League was performed, and the visual reaction times of these players were determined. Official Southern Baseball League statistics were consulted to obtain the players' batting average, fielding average, and earned run average. RESULTS: The mean visual reaction time for all players was 239 msec. There was no significant association between mean VRT and age or race. The mean VRT for dominant eyes was not significantly different from the mean VRT for nondominant eyes. For the 92 players who batted at least 100 times, an association was found between mean VRT and batting average (p = 0.017). For the 168 fielders in the league playing at least 20 games, no statistically significant association was found between mean VRT and fielding average. Similarly, no association was found between mean VRT and earned run average for the B8 pitchers who had participated in more than 20 games. CONCLUSIONS: An association was found between visual reaction time and batting skill in baseball. No association was found between visual reaction time and fielding or pitching skill.

The present work investigates a linear Hebb-trained neural network model for the simultaneous self-organization of receptive field profiles, their arrangement into orientation maps, and the segregation of ocular dominance stripes. Both ON- and OFF-center type input neurons are considered. The requirement of a simultaneous formation of several structures leads to the prediction of additional necessary properties of the input correlation functions. The receptive field- and orientation map formation behaviour predicts, that the range, where ON-ON-correlations exceed ON-OFF-correlations within the LGN, should be about 0.6 times the retinotopic radius of thalamocortical axonal arbors. Additionally, the emergence of ocular dominance stripes requires an asymmetry between ON-ON and ON-OFF correlation functions. © 1995, Springer Verlag. All rights reserved.

This assumption was based on the morphological differences between the nasal and the temporal hemiretinas and on physiological data. It was assumed that the hemisphere receiving visual information via the nasal optic fibers, that is, the hemisphere contralateral to the viewing eye, would be the more activated one. Because heartbeat perception is regarded as a predominantly right hemispheric function, it was predicted that during right hemispheric activation created by left monocular viewing heartbeat discrimination performance would be better than during left hemispheric activation created by right monocular viewing. This hypothesis was tested on 30 male right-handed university students who performed a Whitehead-type heartbeat discrimination task while viewing only with the left or with the right eye. Heartbeat perception was more accurate when viewing with the left eye. Additionally, respiratory manipulation during heartbeat discrimination improved performance on this task.

The visual requirements of this task are very similar to those needed for use of a similar head-mounted information display under study as a primary information aid for manual aircraft wire harness assembly. The subjects visually traced the snake-like and rectilinear wire paths with a visual cursor before their dominant eye. Three subject groups used either monocular, biocular, or stereoscopic display conditions for 30 minutes of tracing. Pre and post tracing subjective measurements of viewing difficulties, disorientation, nausea, and measures of stereoscopic threshold, near and far horizontal and vertical phoria were made. Only the viewing difficulty, i.e. the eye and head/neck aches score, changed significantly. Biocular conditions were worse than either monocular or stereo which were nearly equivalent for this measure. The biocular viewing difficulties are likely due to conflicting looming and stereo disparity cues to vergence. Accordingly, special geometric design enhancements probably will be needed for biocular displays for work within arms reach.

The position of both eyes relative to each other is monitored by means of two haploscopically seen vertical lines presented in the central visual field, one above and one below a binocularly seen horizontal line. The subject is instructed to shift one of the vertical lines horizontally until the two are aligned, while fixating their intersection with the horizontal line. It has recently been questioned whether the foveolae really are pointed at the perceived intersection. To investigate this matter, we registered the position of one eye while intermittently covering the fellow eye, while the subject maintained fixation of the intersection. We found slight differences in monocular eye position depending on the presence or absence of fusion in the macular periphery, confirming earlier findings in part. These differences were more pronounced in the nondominant eye.

Four topics are studied: 1) Image reversal in the looking-glass: making his self-portrait, the painter looks at a self-image in a mirror, and so is copying an image of himself where right and left are, so to speak, inverted; eyes, ears, clothes, and, above all, hands: the real right hand is the left hand in the picture, and the real left hand is the right hand in the picture. 2) Due to this reversal, the painter has two possibilities: either he can accept this apparent reversal, and represent himself as left-handed (painting using his left hand); or he can refuse this apparent reversal, and correct the reflected image in the picture. Both these options have in fact been used by painters, depending on whether they painted before or after the birth of photography: - before photography, painters, generally, refused to seem left-handed; so, they used many tricks to correct the reflected image: suppression of the two hands in the self-portrait; suppression of the painted left hand (i.e. the real right hand); brushstoke in the painted right hand (i.e. the real left hand) and/or palette in the left painted hand (i.e.; the real right hand); only a few painters accepted to seem appearing left-handed in the self-portrait; - on the contrary, after the birth of photography, painters willingly accepted appearing left-handed; photography providing a real, objective image of the artist, he could now express his subjectivity, painting the image of himself as perceived in the looking-glass. Nevertheless, the representation of the real right hand was always difficult, this hand being not able to be, at the same time, at rest as a model for the painter, and in movement for the sake of painting. 3) The fact that the painter is left-handed can, according to Linksz, be deduced from the orientation of the hatchings representing shade in the drawings: the hatchings go down from right to left in right handed painters, and go down from left to right in left handed painters. 4) Since the right eye is usually dominant, one can distinguish a self-portrait from a simple portrait by the eyes: in a simple portrait, the right eye of the picture looks directly at the viewer; in a self-portrait, the left eye seems, on the contrary the fixating eye, since it is, in fact, the real right eye."

The level of streptavidin attached to the combs was used to control the amount of immobilised material. Thus, the need for titration of PCR products to fit the dynamic range of the sequencer was reduced. The method was used to investigate the possibility of quantitating allele frequencies in pools of DNA from family members with the autosomal dominant eye disorder Best's macular dystrophy. The method allowed the detection of one unique allele in a background of 39 other alleles. Using independent datasets, it was further found that the method was able to detect distorted allele frequencies in affected individuals of one family as compared to reference individuals, for markers located more than 30 cM from the disease locus. It was found that this procedure is a powerful alternative to conventional linkage analysis and the method may prove useful in a genome scan for genes involved in complex disorders.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if diagnostic occlusion of the dominant eye was still more effective in this respect. In 19 patients diagnostic occlusion was performed on the deviating eye as well as on the dominant eye. In 13 patients a vertical deviation could be elicited. The size of the vertical deviation was almost the same irrespective of which eye was occluded. The horizontal deviation both for distance and near was slightly larger after occlusion of the dominant than of the non-dominant eye. The fusion capacity was increased after occlusion more often after occluding the non-dominant than the dominant eye. Anomalies such as dissociated vertical deviations and A- and V-pattern were equally well diagnosed by occlusion of either eye. For a full diagnostic setup of patients with intermittent exotropia, occlusion of each eye separately is recommended in order to elicit maximal horizontal and vertical deviation. © 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

The system can control 3D image output, measuring binocular eye movements simultaneously. We focused on the interaction between both eyes and measured binocular eye movements while showing a moving stimulus to one eye and a stationary stimulus to the other. Asymmetric conjugate or convergent eye movement occurred, and there was a tendency for convergence eye movement with stereopsis. The tendency for binocular eye movement differs individually. There was a tendency for convergent eye movement when the stimulus was in front of the screen. Also, the dominant eye had a tendency to reach peak velocity earlier than the other eye even if the dominant eye did not see the moving stimulus. © 1994, Elsevier B.V.

We characterized the reading errors made by 64 right-handed adults with complex partial seizures (half with seizure foci on the right and half on the left), after right hemisphere injection of sodium amobarbital. Subjects were presented with 20 six-word sentences and all were found to have speech associated with the left hemisphere only. A variety of reading errors occurred, most of which fell under the syndrome of 'neglect dyslexia' including deletions and substitutions of whole words on the left side of a line of text as well as within-word neglect errors. The nature of these errors indicated that they may have been caused by an interaction between a peripheral processing deficit and more centrally located conceptual knowledge of linguistic structure. Other errors could be attributed to a general decrease in attentional mechanisms. Neglect errors at the level of the sentence occurred in the absence of neglect errors at the level of the word although the converse was not true. This suggests that the latter may represent a more severe deficit in the mechanism that causes the former. A double dissociation existed between single word neglect dyslexia errors and 'visual' errors, indicating separate processing mechanisms.

In addition, they were tested with dichotic listening for correct reports of consonant-vowel syllables. The two groups of children were closely matched on IQ and sensory functioning. Children with mental retardation, or epileptic seizures were not included. The results showed that 89% of the left hemisphere impaired (LHI) children were left-handed, all of them preferred the left foot, and 72% were left eye-dominant. In the right hemisphere impaired (RHI) group, everyone (100%) preferred the right hand and foot, and 62% were right eye dominant. The dichotic listening results showed a significant right ear advantage (REA) in the RHI-group, and a significant left ear advantage (LEA) in the LHI-group. The results are discussed in the framework of pathological handedness and shifts in hemisphere control of language in children with early brain injury. It is argued that the homogenous samples, except for the site of lesion, provides an interesting possibility to compare cognitive effects of left and right hemisphere impairement in children. © 1992.

Our contribution to epistemology centers on the scanpath theory of vision: that internal cognitive models control active looking eye movements, perception, and active vision in a top-down fashion. Quantitative evidence about experimentally recorded scanpaths has recently been obtained in the form of string editing distances which measure the similarities and differences between scanpaths made by different human observers as they view a variety of pictures. A decisive new experiment documented that scanpaths during visual imagery tasks and those scanpaths formed while looking at actual pictures were the same. The subject's tasks during the imagery period was to imagine the previously viewed picture. Our contribution to ontology stems from the new field, popularly known as ""virtual reality"". This ""hype"" name describes virtual environments formed by computer generated dynamic pictures projected on video screens and worn as head-mounted displays. Interaction, immersion, and interest provide routes to a sense of ""telepresence,"" the compelling feeling that the human subject is acting and behaving in this distant artificial environment. This raises the ontological question, ""Why does one feel present in the pupil of one's own dominant eye, here and now, in the so-called 'native reality'?"" The answer is that normal vision, like virtual reality, is formed by illusions - of completeness and clarity, of space constancy, of continuity in time, of instantaneous action, of vivacity - and these illusions create our sense of presence. © 1996 Elsevier B.V.

Despite similar (four dizygotic pairs) or identical (six monozygotic pairs) genetic endowment and grossly similar intra‐ and extra‐uterine environmental and socio‐economic influences, the consistency of the differences between the hydrocephalic children and their seemingly normal twins indicate systematic differences in pre‐, peri‐ and/or early postnatal organization and development of hemispheric function. Follow‐up studies also documented development of above‐average intelligence, despite drastically reduced cerebral mantle size in hydrocephalus of early onset. The atypical patterns of development of the non‐hydrocephalic twins also confirm previously described qualifications reported in studies of the significance of genetic vs. environmental factors in twins. Jumeaux discordants pour l'hydrocéphalie Une étude portant sur 10 paires de jumeaux discordants pour une hydrocéphalic survenue en début de vie a révélé des différences frappantes dans le degré et la nature du développement des fonctions cognitives verbales vs. non‐verbales, l'ordre de naissance et les préférences main‐oeil. En dépit d'un programme génétique semblable (quatre paires dizygotes) ou identique (six paires monozygotes) et des influences intra‐ et extra‐utérines, et socio‐économiques globalement identiques, la consistence des différences entre les enfants hydrocéphales et leurs jumeaux apparemment normaux indique des différences systématiques dans l'organisation pré‐, péri‐ et ou précocement post‐natale et le développement de la fonction hémisphérique.

Trotz ähnlichem (vier dizygote Paare) oder identischem (sechs monozygote Paare) genetischem Material und weitgehend gleichen intra‐ und extrauterinen Umwelt‐ und sozioökonomischen Einflüssen, deutet die Übereinstimmung der Unterschiede zwischen Kindern mit Hydrozephalus und ihren offenbar normalen Zwillings‐geschwistern auf systematische Unterschiede in der prä‐, peri‐ und/oder frühen postnatalen Organisation und Entwicklung der Hemisphärenfunktion hin. Bei Kontrolluntersuchungen zeigte sich eine überdurchschnittliche Intelligenzentwicklung trotz deutlich verminderter Hirnrinde bei früh beginnendem Hydrozephalus.

A pesar de una genética similar (cuatro pares dizigóticos) o idéntica (seis pares monozigóticos) y un entorno más o menos similar intra y extrauterine y similares influencias socio‐economicas, la consistencia de las diferencias entre los niños hidrocefálicos y sus mellizos normales indica que hay diferencias sistemáticas en la organización pre‐, peri‐ y/o postnatal de la función hemisférica.

"McGill E.C.; Erickson P.";0.0;Sighting dominance and monovision distance binocular fusional ranges.;1991;Journal of the American Optometric Association;0;Clinicians typically apply the distance correction to the dominant sighting eye in fitting presbyopic patients with monovision (MV) contact lenses. We evaluated the effect of this fitting strategy on distance binocular fusional ranges for 23 presbyopic subjects. This sample was composed of successful and unsuccessful MV wearers. Fusional ranges for the two MV fitting possibilities (distance lens on the dominant eye, near lens on the dominant eye) were compared to fusional ranges in which both eyes were fitted with the distance correction. A greater esophoric shift and greater reduction in vergence ranges were demonstrated when the non-dominant eye received the clear image compared to when the dominant eye received the clear image. Successful MV patients demonstrated these effects to a lesser degree than did unsuccessful patients. In general, effects of MV on distance binocular fusional ranges were fewer when successful MV subjects received the clear image in the dominant eye.

Cystoid macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma can cause profound visual loss.

"Mears A.J.; Pearce W.G.; Mirzayans F.; Walter M.A.";0.0;Iridogoniodysgenesis is genetically distinct from Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome;1996;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;0;Purpose. Iridogoniodysgenesis (IGD) is an autosomal dominant eye disorder characterized by anterior segment malformations, including iris hypoplasia and iridocorneal angle anomalies. Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome (ARS) is a related autosomal dominant disorder characterized by iris hypoplasia, a prominent Schwalbe's line with adhesions between this line and the iris, plus non-ocular features including maxillary hypoplasia and hypodontia. ARS has been mapped to 4q25 and it has been recently suggested that this locus may also represent the underlying defect in familial iris hypoplasia. We planned to identify the chromosomal location of the IGD locus to determine if the two disorders are genetically related. Methods. Clinical examinations were performed on 70 members with 30 affected from an IGD kindred. Microsatellite markers and PCR were used to conduct linkage analysis. Results. Linkage analysis in the IGD family excluded the 4q25 region containing the ARS locus. Additionally approximately 50% of the genome has been excluded for IGD including 1q21-1q23 (primary open-angle glaucoma). Further linkage analysis is in progress. Conclusions. Genetic analysis on a pedigree with IGD has excluded the 4q25 region to which the ARS locus has been mapped, indicating that these two disorders are genetically distinct.

Various developmental clues, however, suggest that the maturation of proprioceptive sensory processing predates that of motor control. We hypothesized that the observed adult pattern of lateralized motor dominance may develop as a consequence of preexisting lateralized ""sensory"" or ""proprioceptive dominance."" To test whether motor preference could develop in response to sensory dominance, we investigated sighting eye dominance, eye lid winking, and handedness in 164 individuals. Subjects winked the nondominant eye significantly more frequently than the dominant eye and independently of their handedness, lending partial support to the idea that motor function can develop in response to sensory function. Specific investigation of the development of the proprioceptive system would be needed to evaluate whether lateralization of motor handedness develops as a consequence of ""proprioceptive"" lateralization."

"Mason A.; Cornelissen P.; Fowler S.; Stein J.";0.0;Contrast sensitivity, ocular dominance and specific reading disability;1993;Clinical Vision Sciences;0;1. We have investigated the possibility that reduced flicker contrast sensitivity and unstable ocular dominance, which is revealed by failure in the Dunlop Test, may be associated in children with specific reading disability (SRD). We measured childrens' contrast sensitivity in two experiments. In Expt 1, we measured the flicker and static contrast sensitivity of 11 SRD children who passed the Dunlop Test, 11 SRD children who failed the Dunlop Test and 11 normal, control children, all of whom were matched for chronological age. We confirmed that, on average, all SRD children were less sensitive to flicker than normals at all spatial frequencies. But SRD children who failed the Dunlop Test were significantly less sensitive to the flickering gratings than those who passed it. 2. We wanted to be sure that these findings could not be attributed to systematic differences in chronological age, reading ability or intelligence. Therefore in Expt 2 we measured the flicker and static contrast sensitivities of two groups of children who differed only in their Dunlop Test performance. Thus the two groups were matched as closely as possible for age, reading age and IQ. Despite these more stringent controls, Dunlop Test failure was still significantly correlated with reduced flicker contrast sensitivity at all spatial frequencies. 3. Together these results suggest that flicker contrast sensitivity and the stability of ocular dominance may be linked in SRD children. Moreover, we suggest that the reduced flicker contrast sensitivities we observed could be caused by reduced magnocellular sensitivity. Finally, our findings support the idea that abnormal visual processing could affect how children read.

"Järvinen P.; Hyvärinen L.";0.0;Contrast sensitivity measurement in evaluations of visual symptoms caused by exposure to triethylamine;1997;Occupational and Environmental Medicine;10.1136/oem.54.7.483;Objectives - To determine whether blurred vision caused by exposure to triethylamine (TEA) can be detected by the measurement of contrast sensitivity. Methods - 41 cold box core makers of three foundries and 82 control workers were examined. A detailed ocular and medical history was obtained from the subjects. The contrast sensitivity of the core makers was measured on Monday and Friday of the same week both before and immediately after work and also on a third day, when air samples of TEA were collected. Contrast sensitivity and visual acuity were measured by optotype figures at full contrast, 2.5% contrast, and 0.6% contrast. The changes in contrast sensitivity were used for the analysis. The results of binocular vision and the results of the dominant eye were analysed. Urine specimens for the analysis of TEA were collected on every occasion when contrast sensitivity was measured. Results - 78% of the core makers had had symptoms of blurred vision, and 31% had had trouble driving or working. The breathing zone eight hour time weighted average TEA concentrations were 0.3-60 mg/m3. The mean urinary TEA concentration after the shift was 35 mmol/mol creatinine. Continuous monitoring showed high peaks of TEA leakage at a core making machine. Changes in binocular visual acuity did not differ between the exposed and unexposed workers. The contrast sensitivity of the core makers decreased significantly at both 2.5% and 0.6% contrast during the working day. In the binocular measurements at 2.5% contrast, sensitivity decreased in 49% of the core makers and 21% of the controls (P = 0.002). Conclusions - The blurred vision caused by exposure to TEA can be documented by measuring contrast sensitivity. The mechanism by which TEA produces symptoms remains an issue of further study.

The other IOL - destined for implantation in the second eye - is favouring near vision, enabling that 60-70% of the light energy will be focussed by the near zone(s) of the IOL. Methods: Modulation transfer function (MTF), Strehl-Ratio (SR) and resolution efficiency (RE) were determined in both foci by in vitro measurement. Defocus curves were performed after clinical implantation as well as after 'optical implantation' by means of an optical device developed by Reiner. Results: In vitro measurements showed superior results of SR and RE in the favoured focus of the MIOL. Defocus curves after clinical and 'optical' implantation yielded higher peaks for visual acuity and contrast in the favoured focus. Conclusion: First theoretical and clinical results do confirm the new concept of asymmetrical multifocal IOLs.

The majority of young subjects were found to have a CS of 1.80 log units or above. The majority of the older subjects were found to have a CS of 1.65 log units or above. CS results were obtained using both sides (A and B) of the Pelli‐Robson chart from 30 (15 young and 15 older) of these subjects. These measurements were repeated under identical conditions, 2 weeks later. There was no significant difference between the results from sides A and B of the chart. The CS scores were shown to be repeatable to within ±0.15 log units or ±1 step. Therefore a significant change in CS score is +2 steps or 0.30 log units. Slight improvements in reliability could be obtained by more careful permutation of letters on each step and a smaller step size. The restriction against these changes is the ensuing increased chart size. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

"Taylor John; Olson Thomas; Martin W.N.";0.0;Accurate vergence control in complex scenes;1994;Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition;10.1109/cvpr.1994.323879;In binocular visual systems, vergence is the process of directing the gaze so that the optical axes intersect at a surface point. Correlation-based methods of disparity analysis provide fast estimates of the vergence error. Unfortunately, most correlation techniques do not provide mechanisms to determine which image locations contributed to a given correlation peak. The result is that large correlation peaks may have contributions from image areas not relevant to the vergence task. This paper presents a vergence system that applies a cepstral filter to multiscale images obtained from a dominant-eye binocular sensor. As used by this system, the cepstral filter has two main advantages: it enhances targets through narrow-band signal suppression, and it supports a back-projection operation to determine the image locations associated with particular correlation peaks. The use of multiscale images allows the system to have both high resolution for precision in the final vergence and a large field of view for a wide range of initial camera orientations without undue computational cost.
"Lin S.-Y.; White G.E.";0.0;Mandibular position and head posture as a function of eye dominance;1996;Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry;0;A recent study conducted at Tufts University, School of Dental Medicine has confirmed the relationship between head posture, mandibular position and eye dominance. The purpose of this study is to assess the temporary eye dominance of children and the change relative head posture and mandibular position. Twenty children were included in this study after the completion of the ophthalmological exclusion screening. All subjects had the sign of eye dominance screened with eye dominance tests. The mandibular position and the 3-dimensional posture of head were recorded. The eye patches were applied over the dominant eye for one hour to achieve the effect of temporary eye dominance change for 10 children. Ten children had the same procedures except for the eye patch procedure. The reexaminations were performed at the end of one hour visit for both groups. Mandibular midline data revealed no change in both control and experimental group. Statistically significant difference in the transverse plane of head posture was observed by means of Student's t test in experimental group. The mean of transverse measurement difference was 14.7°, with a standard deviation of 6.4265°. The T value was 5.66, with a probability of p =0.0003 at DF =9. The differences of positions were not statistically significant (p<0.05) on horizontal and vertical planes. The transverse head postural change has been demonstrated by means of temporary eye dominance change. This study high-lights several areas: the importance of clinical intervention in young children, the difference on transverse dimensional change, and the importance of role of pediatric dentistry among interdisciplinary cooperation. Further investigation and early clinical intervention is encouraged.

Nevertheless the benefit of early spectacle correction in young children is beeing discussed controversially. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective study the records of 103 strabismic children were analyzed. Myopic children and those with hypermetropia less than 2.0 diopters without astigmatism were excluded from this study. Visual acuity of the dominant eye only was compared between the following subgroups: early spectacle correction (A) not later than at the age of 30 months; 'early' spectacle correction (B) between 30 months and 4 years; late spectacle correction (S) after the age of 8 years. In further subgroups we analyzed hypermetropia of more than 3.0 diopters and the combination of hypermetropia and astigmatism of 1.0 diopter or more. Visual acuity was determined using commercially available target projectors 2 times with an interval of at least 3 months. For analysis, the mean of these two examinations was calculated. In all children visual acuity after the age of 8 years was analyzed, the children of group S wore their glasses at least 6 months before the first determination of visual acuity included in this study. The dominant eye was analyzed only. Results: Early corrected eyes developed better visual acuity than late corrected ones: 45% of the early corrected children (A + B) had a visual acuity exceeding 1.0 (20/20) versus 22% in the late corrected (S) subgroup (p=0.046). 53% of the children corrected within the first 30 months (A) developed a visual acuity exceeding 1.0 (20/20) compared with 22% in the late corrected subgroup (p=0.019). In hypermetropia exceeding 3.0 diopters (without astigmatism) the difference of early correction (A + B) compared with late correction (S) was even more significant: 72% of early corrected children developed a visual acuity of better than 1.0 (20/20), but no child corrected late did so (p=0.0015). On the other hand, no child in these 2 subgroups developed a visual acuity of below 1,0 (20/20). Astigmatic eyes had a worse visual acuity: 13% of the early corrected subgroup (A) developed a visual acuity below 1.0 (20/20) versus 55% in the late corrected (S) subgroup (p = 0.024). Conclusions: Early correction of hypermetropia (3.0 diopters or more) and of hypermetropic astigmatism (1.0 diopter or more) results in better development of visual acuity as measured at the age of 8 years or later. Since visual acuity of better than 1.0 (20/20) is 'normal', late corrected children often did not develop 'normal' visual acuity. By early correction of relevant hypermetropia and hypermetropic astigmatism this 'refractive amblyopia' at least in part could be avoided."

The extent of the association of handedness and eyedness is unclear, as some eyedness measures are potentially contaminated by measures of handedness. A meta-analysis of hand-eye concordance in 54,087 subjects from 54 populations, found that concordance was 2.69 x greater in questionnaire rather than performance studies, 1.95 x greater in studies using unimanual monocular performance measures, and 6.29 x greater in studies using non-sighting measures of eye-dominance. In the remaining studies, which seemed to show no evidence of bias, the odds-ratio for hand-eye concordance was 2.53 x; in a population with 9.25% left-handedness and 36.53% left-eyedness, 34.43% of right-handers and 57.14% of left-handers are left-eyed. This pattern of hand-eye association poses problems for genetic models of cerebral lateralisation, which must invoke pleiotropic alleles at a single locus or epistatic interactions between multiple loci. There was no evidence that the incidence of eyedness, or the association between eyedness and handedness, differed between the sexes."

The model of Miller et al. is based on four biological features which are also explicitly incorporated into the authors' models, with a different technical realization. While Miller et al. set up a differential equation, the authors' model is described as a multistage algorithm. Another main difference is that the authors use a two-level neurodynamic model taking explicitly into consideration even the single neuron activity dynamics."
Dunham Jr. P.;0.0;Coincidence-anticipation performance of adolescent baseball players and nonplayers.;1989;Perceptual and Motor Skills;0;10 adolescent baseball players and 10 nonplayers made estimates of baseballs' arrival at the front edge of a home plate. Balls were projected 45 ft. by a pitching machine at speeds of 35, 40, 45, and 50 mph. Subjects made estimates with the dominant and nondominant eye closest to the oncoming ball. Analysis indicated that players were no more accurate than nonplayers but did respond significantly earlier and with consistency. Eye dominance had no effect on performance.
Amira L.;0.0;Modeling binocular vision: Loss of 3D in the presence of rivalry requires a new approach;1992;Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering;10.1117/12.135995;"In a dichoptic stimulus, where one feature in one eye could participate in both rivalry and stereopsis with features in the other eye, 3D perception was lost intermittently. The periods of loss of 3D percept were positively correlated with the periods of rivalrous suppression, and the degree of difference in rivalrous suppression between the eyes, due to variable eye dominance, was positively correlated with the degree of loss of 3D percept1. This suggested that because differential luminance between the eyes affects their dominance in rivalry, stereopsis in the presence of rivalry would be similarly affected, and we now suggest that it is. These results are not predicted by any of the presently popular accounts of how rivalry and ""fusion"" coexist-Instead, it seems that rivalry and ""fusion"" are not two modular processes and that rivalry and stereopsis are affected by the same factors within an interactive network. © 1992 SPIE.

Enright J.T.;0.0;"Onset-of-vergence saccades are unrelated to the location of Hering's ""cyclopean eye""";1996;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;0;"At the onset of convergence between targets aligned on the visual axis of one of the eyes, the aligned eye usually makes a seemingly pointless saccade in the temporal direction. Larger saccades typically arise when the targets are aligned in front of the non-dominant eye. Pickwell (1972: Vision Res. 12: 1499) proposed - and others have accepted (e.g., Carpenter, 1988: Movement of the Eyes) - that this asymmetry reflects a lateral displacement toward the dominant eye of the subjective ego-center (Hering's ""cyclopean eye""). Purpose: to compare onset-of-convergence saccades with location of the subjective ego-center. Methods: eye movements monitored by video; subjective ""straight-ahead"" assessed by repeated placement of a small light, in a totally dark surround, with tests at Far (3 m) and at Near (30 cm) distances. Results: The location of the subjective ego-center can be inferred by extrapolation to the inter-ocular axis of the line that connects the average Far and Near subjective straight-ahead positions. Overall, most of those locations were close to the midline: the ""cyclopean eye"" is usually well centered. The saccadic data were biased, as Pickwell reported, toward larger saccades when alignment was with the non-dominant eye, and inter-subject variation in bias was conspicuous. There was, however, no cross-subject agreement whatever between those saccadic biases and the location of the subjective ego-center. Conclusion: Hering's ""cyclopean eye"" - a metaphor based on perception - seems to be irrelevant to sizes of onset-of-vergence saccades. This bias in oculomotor performance can be better interpreted as a consequence of weighted averaging, by the saccade generator, of binocularly different visual stimuli, with dominant-eye input given greater weight (Enright, 1992: Vision Res. 32: 2261)."

There is accumulation of phospholipid, unesterified cholesterol and cholesterol ester in the corneal stroma; this is believed to be due to an imbalance in the local factors affecting lipid/cholesterol transport or metabolism. The cellular mechanism of abnormal lipid transport and metabolism in SCCD is of interest due to its potential involvement in atherosclerosis, and its implications for the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular, coronary and peripheral vascular disease as well as corneal opacification. To determine the chromosomal location of the SCCD locus, genome-wide linkage analysis has been performed in two large Swede-Finn kindreds recently identified in central Massachusetts. After analysing 300 microsatellite markers > 90% of the genome was excluded from linkage to the SCCD locus. We now report the chromosomal assignment of the gene for SCCD in both families to be 1p34.1-p36; the maximum multipoint led-score was 8.48 in the interval between D1S214 and D1S503. From haplotype analysis, the SCCD locus lies in the 16 cM interval between markers D1S2663 and D1S228. Several candidate genes for SCCD have been localized to the 1p34.1-p36 interval."

Target pairs were preceded by a brief (200 ms) related or unrelated (prime) word presented to the nondominant eye. Each participant performed 2 blocks of association judgment task trials: 1 with primes that were legible, and 1 with primes that were masked by a pattern simultaneously presented to the dominant eye. Across 2 experiments, significantly larger masked priming effects were observed for participants who could not detect priming words (low-d′ participants) than for participants who could partially see priming words (high-d′ participants). This result suggests that undetectable masked primes can activate word meaning and that conscious attempts to process masked primes may inhibit unconscious activation. Additionally, evidence is presented that supports claims that spreading activation is the crucial mechanism responsible for unconscious priming. © 1995 American Psychological Association.

In the first survey (N = 686), sighting eye dominance was found to be related to handedness. In the second (N = 799), arm folding and leg crossing, but not hand clasping or spreading the fingers, were found to be related to handedness. Although these variables are correlated with handedness, they do not have the properties that would make them likely to improve prediction of cerebral lateralization. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

Design: Dichoptic viewing was achieved by dissociation of right and left eyes using a septum and crosspolarization. Brightness matches were obtained by using adjustments to the illumination of the left retina while the illumination of the right retina was kept constant. Observers: Ninety-one control observers (age range, 20 to 91 years) participated in the study to provide normal brightness-matching data. Results: Effects from ocular dominance, age, and long- and short-term adaptation were negligible, but the test was sensitive to anisocoria. Just noticeable differences in dichoptic brightness matching were proportional to retinal illuminance; this finding was consistent with the Weber-Fechner law. Conclusion: The test is quick and simple to complete and appears to offer considerable scope for the assessment of visual function when differences in the functional integrity of the optic nerves of the right and left eyes are suspected. © 1994, American Medical Association.

Breedlove H.W.;0.0;Prescribing for marksmen and hunters.;1993;Optometry clinics : the official publication of the Prentice Society;0;Marksmen and hunters present unique challenges to the prescribing optometrist. History-taking must be thorough, to discover the specific interests of the patient, the weapon used, and the level of skill. Appropriate protective eyewear should be prescribed for all hunters and marksmen, with well-designed frames and polycarbonate lenses. Providing excellent distance acuity is an obvious requirement for these persons, and not only Snellen charts but also contrast sensitivity may be used to measure acuity. The most demanding patient is a presbyopic pistol shooter, who may require the use of apertures, low plus lenses or adds, or special design eyewear to provide the acuity needed for the alignment of front and rear sights. Another problem is eye dominance, which may be a consideration for left-eye (crossed) dominant individuals. Physiological diplopia may be a concern for beginning marksmen, and occlusion of the nonsighting eye or training to learn to ignore the diplopia may be necessary. Optometrists should be prepared to offer these and other services to this interesting class of patients.

These factors were investigated in 43 control and 39 dyslexic children, who were matched for age, sex and performance intelligence quotient. The dyslexic group exhibited significantly lower positive and negative vergence reserves, and vergence instability when the eyes were dissociated at near. Their amplitudes of accommodation also were significantly reduced. However, other measures including dissociated and associated heterophoria and accommodative lag and facility were similar in both groups. The stability of motor ocular dominance, as assessed with a modified Dunlop test, was similar in both groups. The results of a simulated reading visual search task suggested that the vergence and accommodative dysfunction were not a major cause of the dyslexia. Further analyses, using reading‐age matched groups, suggested that these ocular motor correlates were not attributable to the better reading performance in the control group. The most likely remaining explanation is that they are, in most cases, non‐causal correlates of the dyslexia. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

Asymmetries of visual acuity and eye dominance were largely independent of motor asymmetry. Asymmetries of stereognosis and finger identification, but not graphesthesia, were associated with various measures of motor asymmetry. It appears that the association between tactile and motor asymmetries varies with the motor demands of the tactile task and that there is little intrinsic relationship between somatosensory and motor asymmetry. Even though the development of motor skill in these children was more impaired by left-hemisphere damage than by right-hemisphere damage, left-and right-hemisphere damage produced equivalent deficits in their sensory and perceptual ability. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

It is shown how this type of network can self-organize into multiple winner-take-all subnetworks, each of which tackles only a low-dimensional subspace of the input vector. This is a rudimentary example of a neural network that effectively subdivides a task into manageable subtasks.
"Robboy M.W.; Cox I.G.; Erickson P.";0.0;Effect of sighting and sensory dominance on monovision high and low contrast visual acuity;1990;CLAO Journal;0;We investigated the relationship between ocular dominance and monovision visual performance in 15 presbyopic subjects. Ocular dominance was determined using sighting (hole-in-the-card and miror tests) and sensory (anisometropic blur suppression test) methods. Correcting the dominant sighting eye for a given viewing distance was found to be an unreliable method of optimizing blur suppression or binocular high/low contrast visual acuity at that distance. If there is any advantage to a particular strategy for selecting the distance monivision eye, it must be realized in vision performance areas other than visual acuity.

Subjects were divided according to their previous musical training and according to their ear and eye dominance. The accuracy of the tuning-performance yields data for an univariate analysis of variance. From the results the conclusion is drawn that the right hemisphere is more sensitive to the dimension of musical harmony. This superiority is discussed with respect to different theories of hearing and the question, if the observed differences are the expression of an innate or a learned ability. © 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

Suppression ability was quantified by reducing the contrast of a bright test target, viewed by subjects wearing a monovision correction, until the blurred image was suppressed. Subjective success with monovision was evaluated using a patient survey and no correlation to blur suppression ability was found. Objective success was evaluated in terms of performance at three near work tasks, each requiring a different level of stereoscopic localization. A significant correlation was found between card filing performance (requiring a moderate level of stereopsis) and blur suppression ability. Correcting either the dominant or non-dominant eye for near in the monovision correction did not significantly affect blur suppression ability. There was no evidence for adaptation to monovision in terms of increasing blur suppression ability over time.

Visual acuity, stereoacuity, biomicroscopy, and pupil measurements were evaluated. The results show that 50% of the subjects were successful wearers when two different center-zone sizes were worn. Success rate improved to 67% when those subjects considered failures, either because of near or distance vision complaints, were refitted with two equal center-zone sizes (2.3 or 3.0 mm).

Binocular distance visual acuity with monovision was approximately equal to monocular visual acuity for addition powers (monocular defocus) of +1.00 to +2.50 D, using both high and low contrast logMAR visual acuity charts. Neither the eye chosen to be defocused (dominant or nondominant) or pupil size (3.5, 5 and 7 mm) affected the binocular visual acuity loss with monovision for high contrast charts. We also investigated the effect of induced residual astigmatism (+0.50, +1.00, and -1.00 D) on binocular distance visual acuity in monovision correction. Residual astigmatism caused a significantly greater reduction of binocular visual acuity in the monovision condition than it did in normal binocular conditions. This effect appears to be related to a process of meridional interocular suppression. It may therefore be of clinical importance to correct low amounts of residual astigmatism in monovision corrections to provide optimum binocular visual acuity. © 1993 American Academy of Optometry.

A 7-week open clinical trial of levodopa (0.55 mg/kg, three times daily) with 25% carbidopa combined with part-time occlusion (3 hours/day), was undertaken in 15 older (mean age, 8.87 years) amblyopic children. Visual acuity, fusion, and stereo acuity were measured at baseline, at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 during treatment, and 6 weeks following the end of all treatment. Health status was assessed by physical examination, questionnaire, and standard laboratory tests (CHEM 20, complete blood cell count [CRC], and differential). The results revealed that visual acuity in the amblyopic eye improved for 5 weeks, from 20/170 at baseline to 20/107, then stabilized for the last 2 weeks. Visual acuity also improved in the dominant eye by 0.6 lines, from 20/19 to 20/16. At the 6-week follow up, visual acuity in the amblyopic eye remained at 20/107 (paired t=4.78, df=14, P<.001), a 37% improvement. Thirty-three percent of the subjects demonstrated improved fusion from baseline to the 7-week trial that was maintained at follow up (χ2 = 3.97,P<.05). Stereo acuity did not significantly change. Physical exam (blood pressure, body temperature, respiration, heart rate) end standard laboratory tests remained normal and side effects were minimal. It is concluded that levodopa/carbidopa combined with part-time occlusion in older amblyopic children improves visual acuity for 5 weeks then stabilizes, and can lead to improvements in visual acuity and in fusion over a period of at least 6 weeks following cessation of treatment, with minimal side effects.

Human anterior segment ocular dysgenesis (ASOD) is autosomal dominant, carriers express an eye phenotype similar to that of Cat4a carriers, and it has been mapped to a region of 4q homologous to mouse central Chr 8. Thus, on the basis of phenotype and map position, Cat4 may be a mouse model of human ASOD. The genes Junb, Jund1, Mel, and Zfp42 are discussed as possible candidates for Cat4.

"Cox J.F.; Leguire L.E.; Nairus T.M.";0.0;Horizontal OKN in amblyopic children;1996;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;0;"Purpose. To determine whether amblyopia in older children reduces horizontal OKN or leads to directional asymmetries, as has been previously reported for infants. Methods. Subjects were 24 amblyopic children ranging from 5-16 years of age (mean=10.0 years). Drifting gratings (0.6 cyc/deg; 14.25 deg/sec) were presented monocularly in 15 second trials, while eye movements were recorded using the EOG method. In separate trials, OKN was recorded for nasalward and temporalward stimulus motion in the dominant and amblyopic eyes. Dependent variables, scored in offline analysis of EOG records, included the percent time in which subjects exhibited OKN, beat frequency and slow-phase gain. Monocular visual acuity was also measured using a ETDRS LogMAR letter chart. Results. The percent time measure was higher for the dominant eye and for nasalward motion. A difference score index of temporal-nasal directional asymmetry on the percent time measure was positively correlated with LogMAR acuity (r=.41, p<.05); subjects with poorer resolution had more asymmetry. Beat frequency and slow-phase gain measures did not significantly vary among conditions. For a given eye, gain scores were highly correlated across directions. Beat frequency scores correlated across both directions and eyes. Conclusions. Amblyopia in older children is associated with reduced OKN and with a directional asymmetry that is positively correlated with depth of amblyopia."

Subjects viewed the VEP stimulus with the left eye and a light emitting diode (LED) with the right eye. They were asked to concentrate on either the VEP stimulus or the LED. The two targets were arranged so that the left eye remained accurately focused on, and directed to. the centre of the VEP stimulus throughout the recordings. The binocular VEP wave became attenuated when the subject concentrated on the LED. The wave was reduced lo around two–thirds of the amplituderesent when concentrating on the VEP stimulus. This reduction in the VEP amplitude is considered lo be due to a binocular interaction because there was a lack of amplitude attenuation when the experiment was repealed with monocular conditions. The results also suggest that the wave is smaller when the non–dominant eye receives the VEP stimulus compared with that when the dominant eye is stimulated by the VEP target.

"Leguire L.E.; Suh S.; Rogers G.L.; Bremer D.L.";0.0;SKILL card results in amblyopic children;1994;Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus;0;Two experiments were undertaken to assess high contrast-high luminance (HCHL) and low contrast-low luminance (LCLL) visual acuity as measured with the Smith-Kettlewell Institute Low Luminance (SKILL) card, in childhood amblyopia. In experiment 1, HCHL and LCLL visual acuity was measured in 11 amblyopic children and in 12 normal children of similar age. The results revealed that HCHL visual acuity was similar in the normal eyes and in the amblyopes' dominant eyes, and was abnormal in 91% of the amblyopic eyes. LCLL visual acuity was significantly worse in normal eyes compared to the amblyopes' dominant eyes, and was abnormal in only 64% of the amblyopic eyes. In experiment 2, HCHL and LCLL visual acuity was measured in seven previously tested amblyopic children, after a 5-month interval, and in six additional amblyopic children. In the amblyopic children who were tested twice, significant test-retest reliability for HCHL and LCLL visual acuity was found and visual acuity varied by 3.6%. The results of experiment 2 corroborated the results of experiment 1 from the amblyopic children. It is concluded that visual acuity in the amblyopic eye tends to normalize under low contrast-low luminance conditions. In addition, the mechanism(s) underlying amblyopia appear also to influence the dominant eye, resulting in superior visual acuity under low contrast-low luminance conditions.

It is expressed in the nurse cells during oogenesis, in the central and peripheral nervous systems during embryonic development, and in the imaginal discs of the larva, tom RNA accumulates in the germarium of ovaries from ca; px females but not in the parental inactive strain, suggesting that this altered pattern of tom expression might be the cause of the high rate of mobilization of this retrotransposon. The specificity of tom-induced eye phenotypes can be explained by the presence of regulatory sequences responsible for expression of tom in the eye imaginal discs of third-instar larvae. These sequences might cause overexpression of adjacent genes affected by tom-induced mutations, resulting in the death of undifferentiated cells located anterior to the morphogenetic furrow. In addition to the full-length RNA, tom is also transcribed into a spliced subgenomic transcript that encodes a protein resulting from the fusion between the amino-terminal region of the first (gag) and the third ORFs. The protein encoded by this RNA shows structural characteristics such as a signal peptide, glycosylation sites, endopeptidase cleavage site, and fusion peptide that are typical of the envelope proteins of retroviruses. Antibodies against tom ORF3 recognize two different proteins present in female ovaries, suggesting that tom might be able to form infective viral particles that could play a role in the horizontal transmission of this retrotransposon."

Non-spatial cues are associated with poorer performance during the middle stages of the menstrual cycle. Motivation increased overall response speed but not attentional measures, whereas increasing age was associated with generalized slowing and directional asymmetries. Right-eye dominance was correlated with slow responses to downward targets. These data suggest that attentional performance is modified by age, gender, and endocrine status when spatial reference is not present. © 1990.

We included an experiment similar to Levelt's own equipment, in which a reversed contrast stimulus was used. In all three experiments, including the Levelt disk-ring experiment, the proposition was rejected. We conclude that Levelt's proposition cannot always be generalized to a broad class of stimulus dimensions and therefore cannot be held against reciprocal inhibition models. © 1993.

We investigated a visual texture discrimination task previously reported to be accomplished preattentively and for which learning-related changes were inferred to occur at a very early level of the visual processing stream. The stimulus was a matrix of lines from which a target popped out, due to an orientation difference between the three target lines and the background lines. The task was to report the global orientation of the target and was performed monocularly. The subjects' performance improved dramatically with training over the course of 2-3 weeks, after which we tested the specificity of the improvement for the eye trained. In all subjects tested, there was complete interocular transfer of the learning effect. The neuronal correlates of this learning are therefore most likely localized in a visual area where input from the two eyes has come together.

Three groups (high- and low-activity and ADHD subjects) reported both spontaneous and deliberate TUTs during a vigilance task. Intrusive thoughts were found to be predictive of drug use/attitudes, but, to a greater extent, sensation seeking accounted for most drug-related behavior. Left-eye dominance was related to increased childhood hyperactive behaviors and to spontaneous TUTs. Of the three groups, subjects diagnosed as having ADHD had more spontaneous TUTs. These results are consistent with biological models. © 1993, Psychonomic Society, Inc.. All rights reserved.
Previc F.H.;0.0;The relationship between eye dominance and head tilt in humans;1994;Neuropsychologia;10.1016/0028-3932(94)90111-2;Previous data suggest that vertical imbalances between the eyes produced by lateral head tilt are linked to ocular dominance, but no studies have heretofore objectively measured head tilt in addressing this relationship. Photographic measurements of the head tilt of 70 subjects were made, along with measures of sighting dominance and vertical misalignment during sighting. The analyses revealed that photographically measured head tilt is significantly associated with vertical imbalances during sighting and with sighting dominance. These data support the theory that motoric dominance in humans is partly related to mechanisms underlying postural asymmetry. © 1994.

Of 12 patients with congenital blepharoptosis, none demonstrated this response. In patients with acquired blepharoptosis, contralateral decrease in eyelid position also was directly associated with severity of blepharoptosis in the opposite eye.

In normal subjects, better hyperacuities were obtained when targets with two gapped lines were aligned either horizontally or vertically. We defined these high sensitivity zones as 'neutral zone of hyperacuity'. The sensitivities of hyperacuity became better when the targets had e bias to farther away from the neutral zone and became worse when they had a bias closer to the neutral zone. Fewer than half of subjects with normal vision evidenced 'neutral zones' that were nearly horizontal and vertical, and the majority of the remaining normal subjects had 'neutral zones' that were rotated counterclockwise. The location of the 'neutral zone' was not significantly correlated with a subject's dominant eye, dominant hand, or direction of dominant head tilt. Attention must be paid to the 'neutral zones', when the hyperacuity testing is performed.

The motor control loop was opened by one eye viewing the target and the other eye covered. Each eye was stimulated monocularly and eye movements were recorded with an infra‐red reflection system. Latency and time constant of the accommodative vergence response to step stimulation or the phase of the vergence response to sine wave stimulation, did not vary systematically with stimulus amplitude or eye stimulated. However, the gain of the accommodative vergence movements was highest in the non‐dominant eye at a particular stimulus amplitude. This suggested that accommodative vergence angles can vary depending on which eye is leading and driving the accommodative vergence system in a specific fixation situation. 1995 Institution Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica

This study investigates if this form of dominance testing correlates with a second type of dominance testing, the eye that will accept the least plus power when viewing a distance target binocularly. The plus lens test more closely simulates the condition under which the patient will be using the monovision correction. The theory is that the nondominant eye will accept more plus to blur than the dominant eye. Our study population consisted of subjects from the ages of 10 to 72 years. Fifty (64%) of the 78 subjects preferred the same eye by the plus lens testing as they did for sighting dominance. Seven subjects (9%) showed the opposite eye dominance with the plus lens test, and 21 subjects (27%) demonstrated no preference in the plus lens testing. The results could indicate that same-eye dominance on both tests may enhance the changes of a successful monovision adaptation.

It was more common (p<0.0008) if the “dominant eye” had been patched (47%) rather than the “non-dominant eye” (16%). In a separate experiment, a number of co-operative subjects were provided with a translucent-coloured occluder to be worn over each eye in turn. They reported a recurring coloured interference in the uncovered eye sparing the monocular crescent. We propose that the loss of vision in the unpatched eye is due to binocular rivalry suppression by the patched eye. This visual disturbance may be a cause of anxiety or risk for the patient.

The mean of the time of exposure was less than 4.5 msec. The time of exposure was independent of handedness, dominance of the eye, sex, or the type of stimulus. Four right-handed and four left-handed subjects showed dominance of the left visual field for the A value, suggesting no correlation between handedness and dominance of the visual field. However, six of those eight subjects were found to have dominance of the left eye for the A value, and all seven subjects with dominance of the left visual field for the D value showed dominance of the left eye (χ2=16.39, p<0.001). It was concluded that dominance of the eye was significantly correlated with visual field.

Level F//2 is an on-center off-surround distance-dependent feedback network. Variations in positional disparity are simulated by shifting activity from an ocular dominance slab within a hypercolumn to corresponding ocular dominance slabs in nearby hypercolumns; variations in the spatial scale of the input are simulated by controlling the dispersion of activity across neighboring hypercolumns.

Unlike limb movements, saccadic eye movements are preprogrammed, unidimensional, and do not involve target impact. Hence, they provide an optimal test of the impulse variability account of the speed-accuracy trade-off in rapid movements. Subjects were required to alternately look at two target lights as fast and as accurately as possible for a period of 10 s. Target lights subtended angles of 5,10,15, and 20°. By restricting target distances to less than 20° of arc, the speed-accuracy relation was examined for single horizontal saccadic movements of the eye. Movement of the dominant eye was tracked with an infra-red eye monitoring device. Fifty saccadic movements of the eye were recorded for each target distance and used to compute the average amplitude, duration, and velocity of eye movements, as well as, movement endpoint variability. An increase in both average velocity and movement endpoint variability with increasing movement amplitude was found. This, together with the unique features of the eye movement system, support the impulse variability account of the speed-accuracy trade-off in rapid movements. © 1985 by The Helen Dwight Reid Educational Foundation.
Sugie N.;0.0;Neural models of brightness perception and retinal rivalry in binocular vision;1982;Biological Cybernetics;10.1007/BF00337283;In binocular fusion, pairs of left and right stimuli yielding the same brightness perception constitute an equibrightness curve in a coordinate system whose ordinate and abscissa correspond to the left and right stimulus strengths. A neural network model is presented to elucidate the characteristics of the curve. According to the model, Fechner's paradox is due to the threshold characteristics of the neuron. If the shapes or movements are radically different between the left and right stimuli, the retinal rivalry is caused. That is, only the left stimulus is perceived at one moment and the right stimulus at another moment. The period of left or right eye dominance alternates randomly from time to time. The distribution of the period is approximate to the gamma distribution. In order to account for this fact, a neural network model is proposed, which consists of a pair of neurons receiving inputs with stochastic fluctuations. The computer simulation was carried out with satisfactory results. The model of retinal rivalry is integrated with that of brightness perception. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.

The resulting threshold data fall on a binocular summation contour well described by a power summation equation with an exponent near 2. We studied the effect of adding one-dimensional visual noise, either correlated or uncorrelated between the eyes, to the grating patterns. The addition of uncorrelated noise elevated thresholds uniformly for all interocular ratios, while correlated noise elevated thresholds for stimuli whose ratios were near 1 more than thresholds for other stimuli. We also examined the effects of monocular adaptation to a high-contrast grating on the form of the summation contour. Such adaptation elevates threshold in a manner that varies continuously with the interocular contrast ratio of the test targets, and increases the amount of binocular summation. Each of several current models can explain some of our results, but no one of them seems capable of accounting for all three sets of data. We therefore develop a new multiple-channel model, the distribution model, which postulates a family of linear binocular channels that vary in their sensitivities to the two monocular inputs. This model can account for our data and those of others concerning binocular summation, masking, adaptation and interocular transfer. We conclude that there exists a system of ocular dominance channels in the human visual system. © 1989.

This feedback mechanism, along with the experimentally derived deadspace operator (representing the depth of field), forward-loop gain, and tonic accommodative bias level have been successfully incorporated into a static model of the normal accommodative system. We extended this model to the investigation of static accommodative responses in amblyopic eyes. The experimentally derived accommodative controller gain of the amblyopic eye was typically smaller than in the fellow dominant eye. In addition, the experimentally derived depth of field was increased in most amblyopic eyes, while the accommodative bias showed no consistent difference between the two eyes. The decrease in accommodative controller gain and increase in depth of field were sufficient to account for the reduction of accommodative responses found in amblyopic eyes. Theoretically, the model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the static accommodative deficits found in amblyopic eyes. Practically, the accommodative controller gain parameter provides a means for uniform assessment of normal and abnormal accommodative function, both experimentally and in the clinic environment.

There were no differences in handedness or sighting dominance. Affective patients, particularly bipolar psychotics, had greater right-handed grip superiority than normals or non-paranoid schizophrenics. Paranoid schizophrenics were similar, being significantly greater in right-sided dominance than non-paranoids, who tended toward a smaller value than normals. Hand grip asymmetry was highly correlated with handedness in normals, but not in patients.

Eye preference was compared with ear preference on dichotic listening for 25 of the hemiplegic children. No independent association could be detected between eye preference and ear preference. In both the children and adults with hemiplegia the preferred eye tended to be on the same side as the damaged hemisphere. Among the adults, this tendency was more pronounced with more extensive lesions, as manifested by aphasia and/or hemianopia. These findings are interpreted as indicating that eye‐sighting preference is unrelated to unitary hemispheric dominance, and that, unlike dominance for hearing and speech, it is not irreversible after a critical period of development. A simpler explanation than incomplete hemispheric dominance is offered for the weakly positive association between mixed laterality and cerebral dysfunction. Préférence oculaire chez les enfants et adultes, normaux et hémiplégiques La préférence oculaire a été examinée chez 32 enfants hémiplégiques, 51 patients hémiplegiques avec début à l'âge adulte, et 57 sujets normaux, enfants et adultes. La preaférence oculaire a été compareée à la préférence auditive en écoute dichotique chez 25 des enfants hémiplégiques. Aucune association indépendente n'a pu être détectée entre la préférence oculaire et la préférence auditive. Chez l'enfant comme chez l'adulte hémiplégiques, la préférence oculaire se situait du même coté que l'hémisphère lésé. Chez l'adulte, cette tendance était plus prononcée en cas de lésions plus extensives, traduites par une aphasie et/ou une hémianopsie. Ces données sont interprétées comme une indication que à préférence oculaire n'est pas liée à une dominance hémisphérique unitaire et que, contrairement à l'audition et au langage, il n'y a pas d'irréversibilité aprés une période critique de développement. Une explication plus simple que la dominance hémisphérique incomplète est offerte par une association faiblement positive entre une latéralité croisée et un dysfonctionnement cérébral.  Bevorzugtes Sehen mit einern Auge bei normalen und hemiplegischen Kindern und Erwachsenen Bei 32 Kindern mit Hemiplegie, 51 Patienten, die im Erwachsenenalter eine Hemiplegie bekommen hatten und 57 gesunden Kindern und Erwachsenen wurde die monokuläre Bevorzungung beim Sehen untersucht. Bei 25 der hemiplegischen Kinder wurde die Bevorzugung des Auges mit der Bevorzugung des Ohres beim dichotischen Hören verglichen. Es fand sich keine unabhängige Beziehung zwischen Auge‐ und Ohrpräferenz. Bei Kinder, wie bei den Erwachsenen mit Hemiplegie war das bevorzugte Auge meistens auf der Seite der geschadigten Hemisphäre. Bei den Erwachsenen war dieser Befund ausgeprägter bei ausgedehnteren Läsionen, die sich durch Aphasie und/oder Hemianopsie manifestierten. Diese Befunde werden dahingehend interpretiert, daß die Bevorzugung eines Auges beim Sehen unabhängig ist von der die Einheit betreffenden Hemisphärendominanz und daß sie, im Unterschied zur Dominanz fürs Hören und für die Sprache, nach einer kritischen Entwicklungsphase nicht irreversibel ist. Für die schwach positive Beziehung zwischen gemischter Dominanz und cerebraler Dysfunktion wird eine einfachere Erklärung als die der inkompletten Hemisphärendominanz angeboten. Preferencia ocular en niños y adultos anormales y hemiplégicos Se examinó la preferencia monocular (hacer punteria) en 32 niños con hemiplegia, 51 con hemiplegia iniciada en la edad adulta y 57 niños y adultos normales. La preferencia ocular se compareó con la auditiva en audición dicótica en 25 de los niños hemiplégicos. No se pudo detectar ninguna asociación independiente entre la preferencia ocular y la auditiva. Tanto en los niños como en los adultos con hemiplegia, el ojo dependiente tendía a ser el del mismo lado del hemisferio dañado. En los adultos, esta preferencia era más pronunciada en caso de lesiones más extensas, manifestadas en forma de afasia y/o hemianopía. Estos hallazgos se interpretan como indicadores de que la preferencia visual no está en relación con una dominancia cerebral unitaria, y que contrariamente la dominancia acústica y del habla, no es irreversible después de un período crítico de desarrollo. Una explicación más simple que el de la domiinancia hemisférica incompleta, reside en la asociación debilmente positiva entre la lateralidad niixta y la disfunción cerebral.

Prior adaptation to a genuine square-wave grating temporarily reduces the incidence of this illusory percept, stabilizing the appearance of a triangle-wave grating. The present experiment measured the effect of adapting to a square-wave grating that was suppressed during binocular rivalry for a substantial portion of the adaptation period.

Penso D.E.;0.0;A study of horizontal directionality and difficulty with reading, writing and spelling;1984;International Journal of Rehabilitation Research;0;The horizontal directionality and the hand and eye dominance of 351 children (183 boys and 168 girls) were tested by the medical officer performing the children's first school medical examination. The children were between 42 and 74 months old. Hand dominance: The hand in which each child held a pencil was regarded as his dominant hand. Eye dominance: Each child was asked to look at an object on the opposite side of the room through a cardboard cylinder held with both hands. The eye to which the cylinder was held was regarded as the dominant eye. Two years after the tests of horizontal directionality and of hand and eye dominance were administered the school teachers concerned with the children included in the study were consulted to ascertain which children were experiencing or had experienced difficulty with learning to read, write and spell (learning difficulties). The incidence of learning difficulties was compared with the results of the three tests of horizontal directionality.
Taylor S.P.;0.0;BINOCULAR COLOUR INTERACTION;1986;Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics;10.1111/j.1475-1313.1986.tb00723.x;Abstract—  Colour filters are used to modify the performance of colour normal subjects on the 100‐Hue test. A short wavelength transmission (blue/green) filter is used in front of the dominant eye, and a long wavelength transmission (red/orange) filter is placed in front of the non‐dominant eye. The change induced by the filters is then assessed monocularly and binocularly in an attempt to understand the processes involved in the binocular interaction of colour. The tentative conclusion is that the visual system uses a sampling procedure to obtain the best colour discrimination possible for a given set of viewing conditions.

Cogan A.I.;0.0;Monocular sensitivity during binocular viewing;1982;Vision Research;10.1016/0042-6989(82)90161-4;Monocular detection of local luminance increments was studied psychophysically, during fusion, rivalry, and nonrivalry. Visibility of contrast flashes occurring less than 0.5 deg away from the center of the fovea, was affected by ipsilateral masking contours in such a way as to suggest that the contrast probe enhanced detectability in the tested eye. Visibility of luminance increments, whether flashed or continuously given in one monocular field, was best when a few contours were present in the tested eye but absent (or suppressed) in the partner eye. On the average, detection was poorest during rivalry. In fusion, detection was intermediate between rivalry and monocular dominance. It is proposed that background luminance summation is the specific mechanism in fusion. © 1982.

All subjects were right-handed, with no familial sinistrality. Forty of the subjects were nine years old, forty were thirteen years of age, and forty were seventeen years of age. Half of the subjects at each age level were male, and half were female. Half of each age-sex group were good readers (who were reading at least two grade levels above their current grade) and half were poor readers (who were reading at least two grade levels below their current grade). Results indicated that older subjects and better readers accurately identified more stimuli than did the younger and poor readers. In general, as the males increased in age they exhibited increasing lateralization. Although male good readers showed stronger lateralization for speech at an earlier age as compared to male poor readers, reading ability had no effect on lateralization for males by late adolescence. Females demonstrated significantly greater lateralization for speech than did males at the youngest age tested. The influence of reading ability on lateralization was variable in the female groups. This precludes a definitive statement concerning the effect of reading ability on hemispheric lateralization in females. In addition to assessments of handedness, all subjects were also evaluated as to eye dominance. A surprising finding of the present study is that eye dominance is a highly significant variable with regard to the lateralization of language functions, and may prove to be a more reliable indicator of lateralization than such variables as sex or cognitive abilities. However, this finding is preliminary and must be investigated more fully. © 1985 The International Christian University Language Sciences Summer Institute.

Secondary effects of eye preference (dominance), order of prism presentation, and differences of results between clinicians were evaluated and found to have no statistical significance. This is another example of the trend to establish normal values for functions routinely measured in the optometric examination. Values are now available for the most commonly used vergence testing methods: the binocular rotary prism in the phoropter, the prism bar, and the handheld rotary prism.

Lateral asymmetry in bodily responsiveness to suggestions was assessed. Overall, right handers were more responsive on the left than right side of the body. There was also a significant interaction between sex and eye (sighting) dominance on asymmetry in bodily response. Nonright handers were more responsive on the right side of the body. The findings support the view that among right handers hypnosis is associated with relatively greater right hemispheric activation. The implications of the findings are discussed in regard to asymmetry in bodily manifestation of psychogenic disorders.
"Greenwald A.G.; Klinger M.R.; Liu T.J.";0.0;Unconscious processing of dichoptically masked words;1989;Memory & Cognition;10.3758/BF03199555;"In three experiments, the subjects' task was to decide whether each of a series of words connoted something good (e.g., fame, comedy, rescue) or bad (stress, detest, malaria). One-half second before the presentation of each such target word, an evaluatively polarized priming word was presented briefly to the nondominant eye and was masked dichoptically by either the rapidly following (Experiment 1) or simultaneous (Experiments 2 and 3) presentation of a random letter-fragment pattern to the dominant eye. (The effectiveness of the masking procedure was demonstrated by the subjects' inability to discriminate the left vs. right position of a test series of words.) In all experiments, significant masked priming effects were obtained; evaluative decisions to congruent masked prime-target combinations (such as a positive masked prime followed by a positive target) were significantly faster than those to incongruent (e.g., negative prime/positive target) or noncongruent (e.g., neutral prime/positive target) combinations. Also, in two of the three experiments, when subjects were at chance accuracy in discriminating word position, their position judgments were nevertheless significantly influenced by the irrelevant semantic content (LEFT vs. RIGHT) of the masked position-varying words. The series of experiments demonstrated that two very different tasks-speeded judgment of evaluative meaning and nonspeeded judgment of word position-yielded statistically significant and replicable influences of the semantic content of apparently undetectable words. Coupled with previous research by others using the lexical decision task, these findings converge in establishing the reliability of the empirical phenomenon of semantic processing of words that are rendered undetectable by dichoptic pattern masking. © 1989 Psychonomic Society, Inc."

This suppression fails to occur with small high-contrast targets viewed under low luminance conditions. The effect of target size and contrast upon interocular suppression of blur was quantified by reducing contrast of a bright test spot, viewed binocularly while wearing various plus lenses monocularly, until the out-of-focus image was suppressed. The strength of inter-ocular suppression was equivalent when the plus lens was before either eye. However, after subjects wore a plus lens over their nonsighting eye for one day, interocular suppression of blur became enhanced when the nonsighting eye was blurred, and it became reduced when the sighting eye was blurred. Succcessful monovision subjects suppressed blur at higher contrast levels than did unsuccessful subjects. These results suggest a possible clinical test for quantifying adaptation to monovision. © 1987 American Academy of Optometry.

This appears to prove that dominance of one eye also means that it is preferred for binocular spatial orientation.

Thirty-seven right-handed adult males and females were videotaped making positive and negative expressions of emotion under posed (verbal, visual) and spontaneous conditions. There were no differences in facial asymmetry as a function of condition. Overall, expressions were significantly left-sided, a finding implicating the right hemisphere. When sex and valence were considered, negative expressions were left-sided for all subjects, while positive expressions were left-sided for males only. Further, positive expressions were significantly less lateralized than negative ones for females.

"Dell'Osso L.F.; Abel L.A.; Daroff R.B.";0.0;Latent/manifest latent nystagmus reversal using an ocular prosthesis. Implications for vision and ocular dominance;1987;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science;0;"Latent/manifest latent nystagmus (LMLN) is a jerk nystagmus with a decreasing-velocity or linear slow phase whose fast phase is in the direction of the fixating eye. Change of the fixating eye by alternating tropias or cover will cause reversal of the LMLN to preserve this relationship. In the dark, where no fixation is possible, the fast phases of LMLN are in the direction of the intended fixating eye; actual visual input will override this effect of intention. A patient with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous of the right eye, which was enucleated at age 9 due to glaucoma, had LMLN with fast phases to the left. His congenitally blind right eye was replaced with an ocular prosthesis whose movements were conjugate with his seeing eye. In the dark, we found that his LMLN spontaneously reversed as the normally fixating left eye became esotropic. Furthermore, as is the case with LMLN patients who have sight in both eyes, he was able to willfully reverse his LMLN in the dark by alternating his 'fixating' eye. We conclude from these observations that the direction of LMLN is determined at a cortical level, is intimately related to the intended fixating eye and that eye 'dominance' is predetermined and not altered by visual abnormalities, including blindness."
Wolfe J.M.;0.0;Reversing ocular dominance and suppression in a single flash;1984;Vision Research;10.1016/0042-6989(84)90044-0;An observer views a long (1-2 sec) monocular stimulus. Following stimulus offset there is a dark interstimulus interval (ISI). After the ISI, brief test flashes are presented to both eyes simultaneously. For ISIs less than 100-200 msec, only the test flash contralateral to the stimulated eye is seen. The test flash in the ipsilateral eye is not seen. For ISIs of 200-1000 msec, the contralateral test flash is seen more clearly and completely than the ipsilateral flash (Experiments 1 and 2). The initial and ipsilateral test flash need not be spatially similar. The initial stimulus can be dim but must be longer than 150msec (Experiment 3). Experiment 3 precludes forward masking or light adaptation as explanation. The effect is relatively independent of the length of the test flash (Experiment 4). The results can be explained in terms of the known properties of binocular rivalry and reinforce the hypothesis (Fox and Check, 1968) that rivalry acts nonselectively, independent of factors such as spatial frequency, luminance, or orientation. © 1984.

For the emotional task, a new procedure is utilized which requires subjects to generate emotional images of positive and negative valence in auditory, visual and tactile modalities. Forty-four normal adult males and females (22 right-handers, 22 left-handers) participated in the experiment. Overall, subjects looked significantly more to the left than to the right in response to emotional instructions, suggesting greater right hemisphere involvement in the generation of emotional images. The same subjects showed no directional bias in response to nonemotional instructions. Although gender, handedness and familial sinistrality did not mediate the direction of eye movements, ocular dominance had an effect. For left-handed subjects, the direction of eye movements to nonemotional instructions was consistent with eyedness, e.g., right-eyed subjects produced right-sided LEMs, and left-eyed subjects produced left-sided LEMs. © 1988.

Performances of subjects falling into either crossed or consistent hand-eye dominance categories were compared on a two-choice button-pushing task. Children performed this with their dominant hand in one of two conditions: verbalizing and not verbalizing their button-pushing activity. Results showed that crossed hand-eye dominant children gave significantly poorer performances than consistent hand-eye dominant children and that the former used their self-instructions in a motoric manner. These findings were interpreted as supporting the view that the functions of cerebral hemispheres in children with crossed dominance are more immature than those in children with consistent dominance.

The contrast sensitivity of 37 patients was also measured using horizontal gratings. The contrast sensitivity of the dominant eyes measured with vertical gratings was generally higher than when measured with horizontal gratings. The difference was statistically significant at spatial frequencies 1 and 6 c/deg. A similar difference was present in the amblyopic eyes only at the spatial frequency 1 c/deg both before and after the treatment. Individual variation was great; in a given patient the relationship between the two measurements varied from one spatial frequency to the next. It has been shown in earlier investigations that contrast sensitivity measurements using gratings reveal important new information in the study of amblyopia. Both tests, used in this investigation, measure visual function in the low contrast domain and improve follow‐up of the changes in vision during treatment of amblyopia when used in addition to visual acuity measurements. Low contrast optotype test seems to measure contrast sensitivity in amblyopia closely similarly to the grating test. The slight difference in detecting a ‘hidden occlusion amblyopia’ at the intermediate spatial frequencies needs further study. 1986 Institution Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica"

The group was within the age range of 10 to 40 years. All subjects had normal ophthalmological examinations, were approximately isometropic, and had refractive errors not exceeding 3 spherical diopters or 1.5 cylindrical diopters. Measurements were made under optimal conditions in the same place and by a single examiner. This permitted obtaining a distribution of 180 acuities for OD and OS. The differences in resolving power detected between OD and OS for each individual were very small. In fact, even resolving power (null differences) was 45%, and visual differences did not exceed 0.10’ in 95.5% of eye pairs. Among individuals whose eyes showed different resolving powers (55% of the sample), there was no correlation between visual acuity and motor sighting dominance. © 1988, The Psychonomic Society, Inc..

Pictures showed large differences in balance point; subjects showed smaller differences, unrelated to handedness or eye‐dominance. Monochrome reproductions produced similar balance scores to coloured reproductions. Chopping a portion from one end of a picture showed that particular features are not the origin of the balance phenomenon, but rather the balance judgement incorporates an integration of information across the entire picture field. In Expt 2 abstract controlled stimuli were used; balance depended primarily upon the position of an object, and to a lesser degree on its size and colour. Experiment 3 used stimuli similar to those in Expt 2 and showed that subjects differed in the way that they extrapolated from side length to the mass of a rectangular object, that vertical position had no influence upon balance, and that the shape of a rectangle did relate to balance, the effect interacting with the degree of artificial perspective induced in the stimulus. 1985 The British Psychological Society"

To test this possibility, we measured stereoacuity and rivalry under similar stimulus conditions in 40 observers. To estimate stereoacuity, a two-alternative, forced-choice procedure was used, wherein observers determined which of two sinusoidal grating patterns appeared displaced in depth. To measure rivalry, observers reported the occurrences of exclusive right-and left-eye dominance; dominance durations and alternation rates were recorded. The results showed that stereoacuity was significantly correlated with binocular rivalry, suggesting that stereoacuity and rivalry may share, at least in part, common neural mechanisms. © 1987 American Academy of Optometry."

Unlike most tachistoscopic and dichotic listening methods, the present method did not require verbal instruction or verbal responses. In addition, the subjects' explicit understanding of the need to fixate visually prior to stimulus presentation was not necessary. Meaningful graphic symbols were recognized more accurately when presented to the hemisphere associated with the dominant eye and hand. Recognition of meaningless symbols was best when they were presented to the nondominant hemisphere. There was a significant hemispheric specialization effect similar to what would be expected in older, normal subjects using traditional methods. © 1986.

Seventy-five observers made judgments of the visual straight ahead. Their judgments varied as a function of both viewing condition and eye dominance. Judgments were biased toward the side of the viewing eye during monocular exposure, while binocular judgments were intermediate in their placement. Both monocular and binocular judgments were shifted in the direction of the sighting dominant eye, suggesting that the reference point for visual localization lies between the midpoint of the interocular axis and the line of sight of the sighting eye. © 1986."
Combs A.L.;0.0;Patterns of lateral preference: hand, eye, thumb and clapping.;1983;Perceptual and motor skills;10.2466/pms.1983.57.3.847;The incidences of four lateral preferences were studied in a sample of 143 college students (81 women and 62 men). These were handedness defined by writing, eye dominance using the Asher technique, the upper thumb when hands are clasped, and the upper hand when hands are clapped. A computer program was developed to obtain the incidence of all patterns of these lateral traits seen in the sample and to indicate which occurred beyond the chance level. The strongest paired lateral concurrence was between handedness and clapping (76.9% for both sexes combined). Greater coherence was found between right preferences than left ones.

Some of these patients are emmetropic and are only complaining of presbyopia others have various ammetropias and associated presbyopia. The correction of presbyopia calls for different approaches, depending on the type of ammetropia. The emmetropic patient represents usually the greatest problem from the point of view of satisfactory contact lens correction. Giving a higher plus correction to the non-dominant eye is often a very acceptable solution for the patient. In the USA this method is called Monovision' It calls for correct assessment of the non-dominant eye, because the additional plus power is placed on the non-dominant eye. The swing-test for establishing eye dominance will be discussed. Binocular over plussing of r171w1 =presbyopic presboyopic patients is another alternative for presbyopic correction. Rigid and soft contact lens bifocals and aspheric multifocals of gaspermeable materials will be discussed in some detail.

In contrast, three other amblyopes, all of whom were strabismic, exhibited regions of normal discrimination alternating with regions of higher thresholds than found in their dominant eye. These results are discussed in terms of a multiple-spatial-frequency channel model. They suggest that there are different underlying mechanisms for the deficits in the two types of amblyopia: the anisometropic pattern may reflect a failure of normal development of spatial-frequency channels; the strabismic pattern is similar to that shown in the periphery of the retina by normal subjects and may reflect nonfoveal-type function. © 1987 Optical Society of America."

Persistence increased with increasing spatial frequency and was longer for oblique than vertical gratings. Viewing condition also influenced visible persistence such that binocular persistence was significantly shorter than for either monocular condition. A post-hoc analysis indicated that this was only true with subjects who were right-handed and right-eyed. Subjects mixed on this relationship showed no differences in persistence across viewing conditions. A second experiment which selected subjects on the basis of this relationship confirmed the results of Experiment 1. The results for the right-right group broaden the generality of the rule showing an inverse relationship between response strength and persistence duration.

A statistically highly significant improvement in the vision of amblyopic eyes occurred during intensive treatment in the hospital. Odusion of the amblyopic eye (inverse occlusion) before the pleopic treatment did not effect the function of the aniblyopic eyes. During 8‐week occlusion of the domi‐ nant eye (direct occlusion) after pleopic treatment changes in the vision of the amblyopic eyes were stastistically insignificant. In some patients there was change in contr;ist sensitivity without a corresponding change in visual acuity. The contrast sensitivity of the dominant eye dec reased markedly during occlusion in 12 patients. Alter a continuous occlusion of only 2 weeks there was a st;itistically significant decrease at spatial frequency 6 c/deg. There was no simultaneous decrease of visual acuity; thus the change can be called 'hidden occlusion amblyopia‘. An additional 8‐week occlusion did not cause any statistically significant decrease in contrast sensitivity, but visual acuity of 2 patients decreased slightly, a sign of beginning occlusion amblyopia.

Four experiments demonstrated that two cues that lead to reliable discrimination do not lead to valid identification. Experiment I showed that, in the condition in which a stimulation of the right eye produced a visual direction toward the right and a stimulation of the left eye toward the left, there was a preponderance of correct responses. In the condition in which a stimulation of the right eye produced a visual direction toward the left and the left eye toward the right, there was a preponderance of incorrect responses. Experiment 2 showed that covariation of responses with visual direction decreased when feedback was provided because subjects sought other cues. Experiment 3, which included binocularly deficient subjects, showed that a feeling-in-the-eye is associated with the eye stimulated by a greater change in luminance rather than the eye stimulated by the target stimulus. When the luminance change was greater in the target eye, the feeling led to reliably correct responses, but when the luminance change was greater in the nontarget eye, it led to reliably incorrect responses. Experiment 4 indicated that the proportion of correct responses covaries with the degree of change in the luminance of the nontarget eye. The responses varied from reliably incorrect identifications, through unreliable identifications, to reliably correct identifications. These findings are consistent with the idea that stimulation of either eye is ""projected"" to the cyclopean eye. © 1985."
"Bigelow E.R.; McKenzie B.E.";0.0;Unstable ocular dominance and reading ability.;1985;Perception;10.1068/p140329;An ocular anomaly, unstable ocular dominance, has been shown to be associated with poor reading performance in clinically selected subjects. A study is reported in which this anomaly was examined in a nonclinical sample. Two groups of children of similar reading performance and IQ but differing in chronological age were selected. The older children had a mean discrepancy between their reading and chronological age of 19 months. Unstable ocular dominance was more frequent in these poor readers. The hypothesis that this instability would lead to more errors and longer decision times for distinguishing left-right mirror-image figures was not supported. If unstable ocular dominance is to be established as anything other than a correlate of specific reading retardation, it is necessary to establish the processes through which it is operative. These have yet to be determined.

Sensitivity appears to be impaired in the suppressed eye, but that eye's residual sensitivity is integrated with the normal sensitivity of the dominant eye.

Ninety-one children (62 boys, 29 girls) who attended a school for children with learning disabilities were selected for the study. The Harris tests of lateral dominance were administered individually, and the children were rated as having right, left, or mixed dominance for hand, eye, and foot. When compared with normative data on dominance in children, the results showed that the occurrence of mixed hand dominance was no more frequent, the occurrence of mixed eye dominance was less frequent, and the occurrence of mixed foot dominance was more frequent in the children with learning disabilities. Results also showed that the occurrence of mixed and crossed eye-hand dominance was significantly different in children with learning disabilities when compared with children without learning disabilities. However, the occurrence of mixed eye-hand dominance was found to be significantly greater in children without learning disabilities than in learning disabled children. Age and sex were not found to affect the occurrence of lateral dominance problems in children with learning disabilities.

Significant binocular advantages ranging from 29.5% (pointers in straws) to 3.7% (reading speed] were measured. Tasks with many disparity cues showed the greatest binocular advantage. This shows that patients with normal binocular vision use binocular cues, most likely stereopsis, to enhance performance. In a second experiment, three subjects with normal binocular vision underwent monocular occlusion for 5 days to investigate whether monocular skills improved to compensate for the loss of binocular vision. During that period binocular performance was consistently better than monocular performance, and both monocular and binocular performance improved, even though the subjects were only gaining monocular experience. Although the S day occlusion period does not simulate the long-term denial of normal binocularity that strabismics or monocular patients experience, it shows that binocular superiority remains after short-term loss of binocularity. © 1986 American Academy of Optometry.

As a means to determine the visual load encountered in VDT work, the fluctuations in accommodation were analyzed using the computer method developed by the authors in eight young women. Visual acuity and amplitude of accommodation in the dominant eye diminished with VDT work time. In terms of the fluctuations in accommodation, it was found that, as VDT work time progressed, the frequency of the peak frequency band range lowered and the low-frequency ratio increased. Compared to the pre-test level, there was a significant increase in the low-frequency ratio after 2 hours of VDT work. With time, the mean number of complaints of eye strain and fatigue increased significantly in VDT work. The low-frequency ratio of fluctuation in accommodation was showed to increase before the number of complaints were found to increase. Results suggested that computer analysis using the scale method offers a faster, more objective approach to measure visual load from VDT work. © 1986, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.

"Metalis S.A.; Niemiec A.J.";0.0;Assessment of eye dominance through response time.;1984;Perceptual and motor skills;10.2466/pms.1984.59.2.539;The present study examined the effectiveness of a new technique for the assessment of eye dominance. 41 undergraduates of both sexes completed the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, as well as two conventional performance indexes of eye dominance. Then each subject was positioned before the video monitor of a microcomputer and asked to view the monitor through a device that presented a different area of the monitor screen to each eye. In these two screen areas the digits 0 through 9 were randomly presented. Within every three trials the first two trials presented a digit to both eyes, and on the third trial a digit was presented to both eyes or to only one eye. There were 20 presentations of each kind: to both eyes, right eye, or left eye. The subject indicated whether the viewed digit was larger than or less than 4.5. This cognitive decision task was a constant in all trials. Analyses were performed on the third-trial response times, specifically, on the response time using right eye minus response time using left eye. For right-eyed people this was a positive number. As predicted, handedness, as assessed by the Edinburgh instrument, was significantly correlated with eyedness, as assessed by the response time procedure. The two conventional indexes of eyedness were also correlated with eyedness as assessed by the response time procedure. This procedure, then, provides a cardinal-scale measurement of degree of eye dominance.

Older pediatric patients (124 patients; mean age, 6.5 years) were tested by the PL grating test and a test of recognition acuity (pictures or letters). On the average, grating acuity was better than recognition acuity. In patients with dense amblyopia or foveal abnormalities, very large discrepancies between grating and recognition acuities were found. In nonamblyopic patients, acuities were no more discrepant than for children with normal eyes. Amblyopia was less dense by grating acuities than by recognition acuities; grating acuities were sensitive, however, to refractive and organic amblyopia but not to strabismic amblyopia. Possible explanations include the heterogeneity of patients' eye disorders, single vs. linear acuity, stimulus size and relative complexity of stimuli. These results can aid in evaluating PL grating acuities of preverbal patients, and suggest modifications of stimuli to investigate amblyogenesis. © 1984, American Academy of Ophthalmology, Inc.

Subjects who preferred to fixate with one eye had difficulty suppressing blur of that eye while the binocular target was within the depth of focus of the nonpreferred eye. A third group showed partial summation of the two monocular depths of focus. Similar patterns of accommodative response, measured objectively with the SRI optometer, were observed in subjects wearing monovision corrections. Accommodative response to sinusoidal variations in blur was controlled primarily by the dominant sighting eye.

Each experiment used six right- and six left-sighting-eye subjects. In Experiment 1, the aperture and the target were collinear with the sighting eye. The mean apparent locations of the aperture when the target was fixated, and of the target when the aperture was fixated, were consistent with only the cyclopean-eye hypothesis; that is, the 95% confidence intervals of these means contained the predicted values from the cyclopean-eye hypothesis but not those from the sighting-eye hypothesis. In Experiment 2, subjects moved the card from the side of the nonsighting eye, and in 88% of the trials it was stopped when the nonsighting eye viewed the target. In Experiment 3, the target was viewed through the aperture with both the sighting and nonsighting eye in six different stimulus arrangements. The 95% confidence intervals of all 12 mean apparent locations of the targets contained the predicted values from the cyclopean-eye hypothesis but none of those from the sighting-eye hypothesis.

In contrast to the P100 latency findings the N80 latencies of the white-black-PVEPs and the N80-P100 amplitudes did not show any significant differences with respect to eye dominance. Furthermore, the colour-black PVEPs did not present any differences of latency and amplitude depending on eye dominance. Thus our results give further electrophysiological evidence for eye dominance as a lateralized CNS phenomenon that is not influenced by colour. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.

Changes during pleoptic treatment;1986;Acta Ophthalmologica;10.1111/j.1755-3768.1986.tb06974.x;Abstract Contrast sensitivity at spatial frequencies 1 ‐ 19 c/deg was measured in 56 children (mean age 10 years), who had received pleoptic treatment. Measurements were done at the beginning and at the end of a pleoptic treatment period as well as at follow‐up using vertical gratings. A deficiency was observed in contrast sensitivity of amblyopic eyes at all spatial frequencies, but it was most notable at high spatial frequencies. Both types of CSF presented by Hess & Howell (1977) were found in all groups of amblyopia. A statistically significant improvement in the mean value of contrast sensitivity of the amblyopic eyes was observed at all spatial frequencies during the pleoptic treatment, although in 12 cases fixation and vision did not improve. Correlation with the improvement in visual acuity was poor. In several cases a change was observed in only one of the two parameters in question. Regarding the better eye, there were some signs of ‘hidden occlusion amblyopia’: in a few cases contrast sensitivity of the dominant eye deteriorated during the treatment period without a change in visual acuity only to risk back to the previous level at the follow‐up. 1986 Institution Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica

The average dark-adapted threshold first obtained from 48 patients, who eventually manifested diseases affecting the scotopic retina, was higher than the average threshold of the 31 patients without scotopic disease. Among the 48 patients with scotopic disease, most (40 out of 48) had abnormal electroretino-graphic b-wave amplitudes; in 23 scotopic b-waves were present but attenuated to ≤ 30% of the normal mean; no scotopic b-wave responses could be elicited from 17. In only 6 of the 40 patients with abnormal scotopic b-waves were the psychophysical thresholds elevated > 2.5 log units. That is, the scotopic b-wave is often sensitive to the effects of the retinal disorders of our patients, but the wider range of psychophysical responses permits investigation and analysis of retinal function. In the 13 patients for whom b-wave thresholds could be determined, b-wave and psychophysical thresholds were not correlated, further suggesting that electroretinographic and psychophysical data provide complementary information about retinal function. Thus the psychophysical techniques are suitable for investigation of the functional organization of diseased pediatric retinas. In patients with retinal disorders psychophysical procedures have enabled description of temporal and spatial summation and adaptation to steady background lights. Examples of results of spatial summation and background adaptation studies are presented in this report. © 1983."

The shapes of the functions obtained during the dominance phase exhibited three maxima at approximately 440,530, and 610 nanometers and resembled functions obtained for nonrivalrous control conditions. However, the functions measured during suppression had a single broad peak near 555 nanometers and were adequately described by functions measured with flicker methods during nonrivalrous conditions. The results indicate that binocular rivalry differentially attenuates opponent-color information relative to achromatic information. Copyright © 1982 AAAS.

Using a reaction time (RT) task, subjects received either: (a) visual (V), (b) proprioceptive (P), or (c) combined V and P (VP) stimuli during the first four days. Each subject was then tested under all three stimuli conditions. Results showed that reaction time to the P cue was always faster than that to V or combined VP stimuli. The order in which subjects were tested under each stimulus modality significantly affected the results such that those subjects who received initial exposure to the V stimulus produced the slowest premotor time scores but the fastest motor time scores. These results suggest that the nature of the stimulus which initiates the volitional task can affect both the central processing requirements to initiate the response, and the qualitative manner in which the motor command is executed. © 1988 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
"O'Shea R.P.; Blake R.";0.0;Dichoptic temporal frequency differences do not lead to binocular rivalry;1986;Perception & Psychophysics;10.3758/BF03207584;"The influence of temporal modulation on binocular rivalry was examined in two ways. First, an uncontoured field viewed by one eye had its luminance sinusoidally modulated at 4 Hz (full-field flicker). The other eye viewed a similar field that flickered at different temporal frequencies ranging from 5 to 16 Hz. Second, orthogonal sinusoidal dichoptic gratings were phase shifted so as to duplicate the range of temporal-frequency disparities presented with full-field flicker. Three subjects recorded exclusive visibility of the rival fields over 60-sec trials. Full-field flicker produced very few reports of rivalry, and was described as resembling ""visual beats"" or as an intermediate flicker rate. Usual amounts of rivalry were reported between orthogonal sine-wave gratings; the field flickering at low rates dominated less. These results were essentially confirmed in a second experiment, designed to minimize individual differences in response criteria by requiring subjects to respond to disappearances of small, dichoptic, nonrival markers superimposed on the rival fields. The markers disappeared in concert with episodes of rivalry suppression of the gratings, although disappearances were slightly briefer than supression durations. Disappearances of markers on full-field flicker were rare, extremely brief, and could be attributed to Troxler's fading rather than rivalry. The absence of rivalry between temporally disparate full-field flicker suggests that rival interactions within transient mechanisms are minimal. © 1986 Psychonomic Society, Inc."
Matsuoka K.;0.0;The dynamic model of binocular rivalry;1984;Biological Cybernetics;10.1007/BF00334466;Binocular rivalry is an interesting phenomenon observed in the human vision. It occurs when the right and left eyes are given different stimuli (pictures). This paper describes a mathematical model which explains the mechanism of binocular rivalry. Our basic assumption is that binocular rivalry is elicited by the mutual inhibition between the right and left visual neuron systems. The mutual inhibition between two neurons is first discussed in detail, where a special emphasis is put on a fatigue effect of neurons, and then its results are applied to a simulation model of binocular rivalry. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.

Gureje O.;0.0;Correlates of positive and negative schizophrenic syndromes in Nigerian patients;1989;British Journal of Psychiatry;10.1192/bjp.155.5.628;The two-syndrome concept of schizophrenia was investigated in a sample of 70 Nigerian schizophrenic patients. The positive and negative syndromes were studied in relation to demographic, historical, neurological and psychometric measures. The negative syndrome was associated with cognitive impairment, behavioural deterioration and left eye dominance, and also with poor pre-morbid educational achievement and longer length of current stay in hospital. The positive syndrome was unrelated to any of the independent variables. The two syndromes were not significantly related, supporting the view that they represent relatively independent dimensions of pathology. This provides further support for the validity of the Type I-Type II subtyping of schizophrenia in populations of patients from different cultural backgrounds, and suggests that the negative syndrome is related to the presence of neurodevelopmental deficits that possibly antedate the schizophrenic illness.

Experiment I shows that ""auditory capture"" occurs with a visual input reduced to a single luminous point in complete darkness, but not with a textured background. The task was to point at a flashing luminous point alternately in the presence of a synchronous sound coming from a source situated 15° to one side (""conflict trials,"" designed to measure immediate reaction to conflict) and in its absence (""test trials,"" to measure aftereffects). Adaptive immédiate reactions and aftereffects were observed in the dark, but not with a textured background. In Experiment II, on the other hand, ""visual capture"" of auditory localization was observed at the levels of both measures in the dark and with the textured background. That visual texture affects the degree of auditory capture of vision, but not the degree of visual capture of audition was confirmed at the level of aftereffects in Experiment III, where bisensory monitoring was substituted for pointing during exposure to conflict. The empirical finding eliminates apparent contradictions in the literature on ventriloquism, but cannot itself be explained in terms either of relative accuracy of visual and auditory localization or attentional adjustments. © 1976 Psychonomic Society, Inc."

Also significant differences were noted for distribution of sighting tests combined two at a time (correlated) when compared with distributions of responses on a single test. Comparison of combined test distributions for classroom and clinic populations yielded significant differences in near point sighting and between near and far point tests. Comparison with the ophthalmological data of Fink confirmed the validity of the findings. All simple and combined score distributions deviated from normalcy. Near point binocular sighting exerts a strong influence on combined score distributions because more mixed-eyedness is indicated by that test.

The second class consists of cells that show a limited form of spatial summation (clearly different from cells of the first class) and exhibits a preference for specific stimulus orientations and directions of movement. Movement in the preferred direction is excitatory, whereas in the opposite direction it is inhibitory. Neither class showed a preference for a specific wavelength of light, and both classes showed ocular dominances.

This reflex was also found in 59 other cases besides latent nystagmus, especially in unilateral loss or high degree disturbance of vision by cataract and trauma for instance. The following results were obtained. The reflex was excited only by the dominant eye. The recessive eye moved as the slave eye toward the opposite direction to that of the forced duction applied to the dominant, or the exciting eye. In general, the reflex occurred in all directions, having a tendency to occur in an outward direction namely abduction predominancy. The reflex also occurred when one eye was covered and the fusion was disturbed, making it the slave eye in normal individuals (latent form). Under general anesthesia, the reflex did not occur. When an intense retrobulbar anesthesia was given to the exciting eye, the reflex was blocked. The findings of electromyogram indicated that the nature of the reflex was a concomitant movement of the both eyes towards the opposite direction to that of the forced duction. The reflex occurred only when light was projected onto the exciting eye. In addition, when the exciting eye was closed at the extreme of the abduction, for instance, the slave eye returned to the primary position; but this eye abducted again when the exciting eye was re-opened (cancel phenomenon). This reflex was considered a kind of proprioceptive reflex which was originated by extrinsic ocular muscles because of the fifth and seventh reasons described above. This reflex was considered to be transmitted to the slave eye through the cerebrum because the reflex time is about 200 msec."

However, a high proportion of children whose reading is backward, despite their having normal intelligence in other respects, demonstrate disordered eye movements, whether or not they are attempting to read. Since reading requires very precise oculomotor control in order to locate and sequence letters or words correctly, this may explain their difficulties. We have used a new test of oculomotor/visual integration to demonstrate that many dyslexics fail to develop stable ocular dominance, unlike normal readers. These children make predominantly visual errors when attempting to read. Simply occluding one eye in order to promote retinal and oculomotor dominance of the other, may improve their reading ability dramatically. © 1981.

Lack L.C.;0.0;Amplitude of visual suppression during the control of binocular rivalry;1973;Perception & Psychophysics;10.3758/BF03205788;To investigate the precise mechanism of control of binocular rivalry, Ss were instructed to attend actively to whichever pattern was momentarily in the nonsuppression phase. Test stimuli were presented tachistoscopically for recognition in either phase of rivalry. Because the differential recognition between nonsuppressed and suppressed phases was no greater for an active condition than for a passive viewing condition, it was concluded that control is not mediated by varying the amplitude of the suppression effect. This result was consistent with control that is exercised by selecting the eye to receive a constant amplitude suppression. In addition, it was found that visual sensitivity of rivalry nonsuppression and nonrivalry were the same for the ocular dominant eye but different for the nondominant eye. © 1973 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

During puberty the distant vision of 15% of the children who had shown a distant visual acuity of 1.0 and more at the age of 10 years changed for the worse considerably (myopisation). The near vision remained essentially unchanged. After puberty 67% of the boys and 60% of the girls were discovered to have a distant and near vision of less than 0.4. At the age of 10 years, 13% of the boys (=60% of the boys who had no normal vision) and 19% of the girls (=80% of the girls who had no normal vision) were provided with glasses. At the age of 16 years, about 20% of both sexes had glasses whereby about 60% of the boys and only 50% of the girls who had no normal vision were provided with a visual help. Right-handers with a distant visual acuity of 1.0 and more at the age of 10 years showed a significant difference of vision in favour of the right eye (p<0.01).

The results are discussed in terms of several partial explantations regarding rivalry phenomena.
Hurst W.A.;0.0;Vision, brain hemispheres, learning disabilities;1981;Contacto;0;"This paper has listed some of the major problems affecting our society. The greatest by far is academic failure caused by illiteracy and learning disability, which has become the major threat to economic existence for many individuals. The cost to our economy is high, since this person produces less taxes, and higher welfare, unemployment, delinquency and crime costs. Cranston, chairman of the Economic Council for Ontario, estimated the total overall cost for this individual's lifetime, in 1964, to be over $100,000. Today it would be closer to $200,000. At a minimum of 12% of the Canadian population of 25-million, this produces an astronomical figure of $6-billion. (With the larger population in the United States, the figure would be closer to $60-billion.) 90% of this failure is male. Sex differences play an important role. It was found in brain hemisphere research that boys change over to right hemisphere dominance as early as 6 yr of age; this lowers their ability to succeed in school. Sex differences were also found in a vision-reading study by the author which showed girls to be far more adaptable at the near point than were boys. It was strongly suggested that the superior hand-eye training and auditory stimulation girls receive in the pre-school period at this distance was responsible, and not genetic endowment. Several facts about vision were given. It is the most important carrier system in the body for: the young child and learning disabled individuals; and in training, the movement (kinesthetic) sense modality should be used, since the relationship of touch and vision is genetically endowed. The potential damage from excessive viewing of television was treated at length, and although hard evidence is lacking, enough facts are filtering through to provide the following concerns. It appears that T.V. is: speeding up the changeover (in the male) from left to right hemisphere dominance, thereby creating illiteracy, dyslexia, and learning disability; and is ineffective in helping the disadvantaged and inner city children. In fact, it may even be causing a large number to regress."

Unilateral ocular-handedness when compared to crossed laterality resulted in superior visual perception of language but poorer form perception. The superiority of the lateralized subjects on the Verbal Test suggested greater differentiation of the hemispheres for language concomitant with greater bilateral form perception, whereas the superior performance of the crossed subjects on the Forms Test suggested greater hemisphere specialization for processing visual spatial information concomitant with greater bilateral representation of written language. No support was found for an “interference” hypothesis which predicted impairment in non-verbal, minor hemisphere functions in less lateralized (left-hemisphere) subjects. The results confirmed the hypotheses: (1) that crossed control in binocular visual functioning is not necessarily indicative of a perceptual problem, and (2) that the advantage of lateralization results from increased asymmetry of function rather than decreased interference between linguistic and non-verbal perceptual system. © 1974, All rights reserved."

"Blake R.; Westendorf D.H.; Overton R.";0.0;What is suppressed during binocular rivalry?;1980;Perception;10.1068/p090223;To answer the question 'What is suppressed during binocular rivalry?' a series of three experiments was performed. In the first experiment observers viewed binocular rivalry between orthogonally oriented patterns. When the dominant and suppressed patterns were interchanged between the eyes observers continued seeing with the dominant eye, indicating that an eye, not a pattern, is suppressed during rivalry. In a second experiment it was found that a suppressed eye was able to contribute to stereopsis. A third experiment demonstrated that the predominance of an eye could be influenced by prior adaptation of the other eye, indicating that binocular mechanisms participate in the rivalry process.

One of these mutations, having no visible phenotypic effect, is characterized by a lethal effect for males homozygous with respect to this mutation, while homozygous females are sterile. This mutation is named 'male killer' and designated by the symbol 'mak'. The gene mak is located in the second chromosome in the locus 54±. The other mutation, called 'almond eye' and designated by the symbol 'ale', responsible for the appearance of diminished almond like eyes, is recessive with respect to its wild type allele and is located in the 3rd chromosome at the locus 47.5. The gene Dfd is located in the same region of the chromosome. The phenotype of the Dfd/ale heterozygotes is normal so far as the size and shape of eyes are concerned. It as yet remains obscure whether the ale gene is closely linked to the Dfd gene causing the phenotypic suppression of the latter or whether it is a new recessive allele of the Dfd locus restoring the normal phenotype in the compound Dfd/ale. In the presence of the gene Dichaete the mutation ale exhibits a dominant phenotypic effect in heterozygotes. Interaction of the ale mutation with certain dominant 'eye' mutations in Drosophila are described.

Letter recognition was better in the right visual field for right-handed subjects, but not for left-handed subjects. Neither form recognition nor dot localization showed a significant visual field effect, or any relation to handedness. Consideration of cerebral speech lateralization as assessed by a dichotic listening procedure did not improve the prediction of visual asymmetries. However, both sighting dominance and acuity dominance were related to the laterality effect, at least on the letter recognition task. The results serve to emphasize the difficulty of obtaining stable laterality effects with nonverbal visual material, and indicate the importance of factors related to eye dominance. They suggest that the laterality effects obtained in letter recognition are unrelated to those obtained with dichotic listening, and therefore are mediated by a different mechanism. © 1973, All rights reserved.

Right ear dominance was found in 62 of 85 right-handed individuals, whereas left ear dominance was found in only 3 of 10 left-handed individuals. In 5 with ambidexterity high tone audiometry failed to show any significant preference. High tone audiometry clearly clarifies cerebral hemisphere dominance and this auditory dominance can be utilized therapeutically as well as prognostically.

"Michaels C.F.; Turvey M.T.";0.0;Central sources of visual masking: Indexing structures supporting seeing at a single, brief glance;1979;Psychological Research;10.1007/BF00309423;When two briefly exposed, spatially overlapping visual fields are presented dichoptically, the identifiability of the first field is a J-shaped function of the interval separating their onsets. Three distinct sources of central masking are inferred from the selective influence of variables at different onset asynchronies. In integration through common synthesis, two fields presented at or near simultaneous onset yield one iconic representation. The distinctiveness of this source is inferred from the selective influence of eye dominance at and near simultaneous onset. At longer onset asynchronies, the selective influence of variables such as mask contrast and degree of contour overlap imply a second source of masking. This source was identified with the inhibition of sustained channels by transient channels reported elsewhere. Interchannel inhibition is proposed to affect the fidelity of the iconic representation, but here the imprecision is due to loss of form-relevant information on the first field. At yet longer onset asynchronies, where the fields are phenomenally separate, a third set of variables (e.g., words vs. nonwords and left vs. right visual fields) show their influence. These effects are taken as evidence of a replacement principle: the iconic representation of the second field directs attention from that of the first field. Here, first-field identifiability is constrained by time rather than by impoverished data. In a final series of experiments, central three-field interactions are demonstrated. A field, inserted into the temporal gap between two fields, is perceptually impaired even though it is separated from the first and third fields by intervals at which, individually, neither field is an effective mask. This second-field depression is accompanied by a first-field enhancement. The three sources of central masking are hard pressed to account for the three-field effects. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.
"Lefevre E.; Starck R.; Lambert W.E.; Genesee F.";0.0;Lateral eye movements during verbal and nonverbal dichotic listening;1977;Perceptual and Motor Skills;10.2466/pms.1977.44.3c.1115;A dichotic listening paradigm was used to study the relation of eye movement to cerebral lateralization. The eye movements of right-handed subjects were recorded during verbal and nonverbal dichotic-listening tasks. Subjects given a verbal dichotic listening task made significantly more rightward than leftward eye movements and showed more accuracy and speed in processing information presented to the right than to the left ear. Subjects given a nonverbal dichotic-listening task made significantly more leftward eye movements and processed better information presented to the left ear. These findings suggest a potentially strong link between the direction of lateral eye movement during dichotic listening tasks and left- and right-ear advantages in performance on such tasks. They also suggest that both eye movement and ear performance may be related to cerebral laterality and when examined in combination both could provide valuable information for the further study of hemispheric specialization.

A split-screen CRT display was used to present separate sine-wave gratings to the observer's left and right eyes. The method of constant stimuli and a modified method of adjustment were used to find sets of binocular test patterns that matched a given binocular standard. Test patterns consisted of the simultaneous presentation of sine-wave gratings that differed in contrast to the left and right eyes. Standard patterns consisted of identical sine-wave gratings presented to the two eyes, and had the same spatial frequency as the test patterns. Binocular contrast matching functions were obtained for several standard contrasts at 1 and 8 c/deg. Binocular matching functions were obtained for luminance increments as well. The binocular contrast matching functions departed from a simple binocular averaging rule, and behaved as if the eye receiving the higher contrast disproportionately dominated the binocular contrast percept. Departures from the binocular averaging rule were slightly greater for higher standard contrasts. Spatial frequency had little effect, and the luminance increment matching functions also departed from the binocular averaging rule. There was evidence for a contrast version of Fechner's paradox and for substantial individual differences in a form of ocular dominance. In a further experiment, additivity of suprathreshold binocular contrast summation was examined by testing the double-cancellation condition. We found no systematic violations of additivity at 1 and 8 c/deg. Models of suprathreshold binocular contrast summation were examined. © 1981 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

These results might explain why pterygium usually occurs first in the dominant eye. A genetic pre‐disposition for the disorder is likely. 1982 Institution Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica

In one experiment subjects' behavior in two sighting tests was evaluated. The data indicated that the reference point used in the tests is not the dominant eye but a central point consistent with the location of the visual egocenter. In a second experiment sighting dominance and the location of the egocenter were measured. The results indicated that the sighting eye is the eye nearest to the egocenter. Further analysis confirmed that sighting tests involve the processing of visual direction specified from the egocenter. The findings suggest that one eye is used in sighting tests because the tests force monocular viewing. The meaning of sighting dominance within the context of sighting behavior was discussed with the conclusion that sighting dominance is best understood as a residual effect caused by the egocenter being to one side of the midline and by the monocular demands of sighting tests. © 1981.

For 19 subjects the second test occurred during the same experimental session as the first; for 20 subjects the retest was conducted in a separate session 1 week later.

The average change between the tests was less than ± 0.3 diopter, even when the retest was a week later. These results indicate a definite stability in individual dark focus values.

Results were compared with those obtained for a control group and were evaluated with special reference to convexity and location of the curve. Significant differences were found between patients with right convex curves and those with left convex curves in the distribution of eye predominance and in labyrinthine sensitivity. The direction of convexity was correlated with the predominant labyrinth for both groups.

A survey was made of studies examining these fluctuations and the factors involved in them. Theories attributing the fluctuations to retinal processes, eye movements, adaptation of feature detectors, binocular rivalry, binocular interaction, and attention are assessed. It is tentatively concluded that the fluctuations of patterned afterimages are due to two cortical processes: One concerns the interaction between contour detectors, and the other involves inhibition between columns for ocular dominance or disparity detection.

"Egeth H.E.; Sager L.C.";0.0;On the locus of visual dominance;1977;Perception & Psychophysics;10.3758/BF03206083;A series of six experiments explored the dominance of vision over audition reported by Colavita (1974). We first confirmed the existence of visual dominance in a paradigm somewhat different from Colavita's: Mean reaction time (RT) to a light was found to be faster than to a simultaneously presented tone, even though the stimuli were equated in subjective intensity and even though RT to the tone presented alone was faster than to the light presented alone. Additional experiments showed that when subjects did not have to respond to light, tone RT was equal or faster (intersensory facilitation) when a light was present than when it was not. These findings suggest that sensory or perceptual processing of the tone is not affected by the light, i.e., that visual dominance is nonsensory in locus and depends on the relevance of the light stimulus. This interpretation was reinforced by other findings which showed that the degree of visual dominance was sensitive to the probability of light, tone, and light-plus-tone trials and to instructions to attend to a specific modality, but was not sensitive to the intensity of the light. © 1977 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

All subjects were in late adolescence. These schizophrenic patients showed more left-sidedness on all the laterality measures. Left eye dominance was highly prevalent in the schizophrenic group (about 75% of the subjects) and had high diagnostic usefulness. In addition, laterality measures of the schizophrenic patients were highly incongruous. Our results support the hypothesis of a specific left hemispheric dysfunction in schizophrenia that is neither shared by all psychiatric patients nor resembles a generalized insult to the brain. Although the left hemispheric dysfunction in schizophrenia is considered to be neurological, the etiological contributions of brain insults and of genetic and environmental factors are unclear. © 1982, American Medical Association.

Larmande P.;0.0;"The eye and hemispheric dominance; [OEIL ET DOMINANCE HEMISPHERIQUE]";1981;Journal Francais d'Ophtalmologie;0;Determining whether a subject is left - or right - handed is a problem usually entrusted to a neurologist, psychologist, or orthophonist. The ophthalmologist is also involved, however, evaluating which is the dominant eye being an important feature of the examination. At the present time, the study of conjugated ocular movements appears to be the most reliable method for detecting hemispheric lateralisation.

Subjects made same or different judgments to hemispherically projected visual arrays of two, three, or four letters and reaction times were measured. No support for a serial vs. parallel hemispheric processing distinction was obtained, but strong support for overall left hemisphere superiority for visual search was found with both the reaction time and error percentage data.

Heywood S.;0.0;Asymmetries related to cerebral dominance in returning the eyes to specified target positions in the dark;1973;Vision Research;10.1016/0042-6989(73)90166-1;Left-handed subjects with left eye dominance and right-handed subjects with right eye dominance show differences of performance, related to their hand and eye preference, in returning the eyes to a target position in the dark, after making saccades away to the left or right. These differences are shown particularly in magnitude of error, but also in amount of undershoot and in the number of saccades made. It is suggested that the observed asymmetries of performance implicate a cortical mechanism concerned with the registration of information about saccadic eye movements. © 1973.

It has been found that in tasks where only one eye can be used (such as sighting down a telescope) ∼65% of all observers consistently select the right eye, 32% the left and only 3% are ambiocular1-4. This preference 5 occurs even when both eyes are open, as when one points to a distant object with the finger-tip. If one alternately closes each eye, it will be apparent that the distant target is aligned with the dominant eye but not with the other.

"Porac C.; Coren S.";0.0;The assessment of motor control in sighting dominance using an illusion decrement procedure;1977;Perception & Psychophysics;10.3758/BF03199484;Walls (1951) proposed that perceptual asymmetries between the sighting dominant and the nonsighting dominant eyes were based upon differences in the monitoring of eye movements. The present research explored this hypothesis in the context of an illusion decrement paradigm. Since illusion decrement seems to occur only under conditions of free eye-movement inspection, it was reasoned that any motoric asymmetries would manifest themselves through differences in the rate and extent of decrement. These predictions were partially confirmed. The sighting eye manifested greater illusion decrement, but the effect remained specific to conditions where both eyes were stimulated. In addition, asymmetries in the interocular transfer of illusion decrement were found to favor the sighting dominant eye. © 1977 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

This paper deals with the working mechanism of this vision aid. The color-information is transformed by the filter into a modulation of brightness which can be perceived also by color-defectives. By evaluating the modulation of brightness for deuteranopes and for protanopes one can see that this vision aid brings better results for deuteranopes than for protanopes. For protanopes it is proposed to use instead of a red contact lens a green one, which could offer advantages.

Electro-oculographic recording permitted detailed charting of the course of the eye movements during the searching process. The aim was to study: (1) certain characteristics of normal visual searching; (2) the influence of a cerebral lesion on the efficiency and strategy of the visual exploration; (3) the factors involved in the phenomenon of neglect or unilateral inattention. In normal subjects: (1) searching time was linked to age and independent of the socio-cultural level; (2) in most cases, visual searching began with a circular movement, commencing most often on the upper left quadrant; (3) the method of exploration seemed to depend in part upon ocular dominance. In each of the four brain-damaged groups (determined according to lateralization of the lesion and state of the visual fields) there was: (1) a prolongation of the searching time especially for images contralateral to the lesion; (2) - an alteration in basic ocular movements; (3) a defective planning of the searching process; (4) a tendency to begin exploring on the side of the lesion. In the case of right sided lesions, with or without visual field defects, space was significantly less explored on the left side, an expression of visual neglect of space on the left; in the group with visual field defects, the factors governing the severity of the visual neglect as defined above were essentially the severity of the hemianopic defect and the involvement of the parietal lobe. The pathophysiology of the phenomenon of visual neglect is discussed.

The established relationship between motoric and cognitive aspects of functional brain asymmetry, found in neurological and normal populations, suggests that the leftward tendency of schizophrenics may be manifested in cognitive and conative functions as well. These results seem to corroborate previous findings indicating that schizophrenia might be related to left hemisphere dysfunction.

Some studies report an association between handedness and sighting-dominance or between sighting-dominance and eye-acuity while other studies fail to detect such relations. The present investigation tested the possibility that sex might have mediated these results as this variable, which was found to be of importance in research on laterality, has been largely ignored by all previous studies. Two hundred subjects (100 males, 100 females) were tested on a measure of handedness, three measures of sighting- dominance and a standard measure of eye-acuity. Handedness was found to be associated with sighting-dominance for males, but not for females. Eye-acuity, on the other hand, was associated with sighting-dominance for females, but not for males. These findings suggest sex differences in the mechanisms through which motoric and, possibly, cognitive lateralization is established. © 1977.

A comparison between the oculomotor behaviour of dyslexic and normal children with no reading problem shows the same types of ocular movements as observed in normal schoolchildren, but they differ in their distribution according to age. Moreover, the evolution of oblique movements, described in normal children and correlated with the degree of schooling, is not the same in dyslexic children, where it instead seems to follow particular patterns. Finally, in stereotyped ocular scanning simulating reading movements, the dyslexics are characterized by the absence of two important stages leading to ocular congruence; scanning with random alternate monocular predominance and scanning with selected alternate monocular predominance. © 1981 Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam."

Although its functional significance has not yet been ascertained, patterns of ocular dominance have been shown to be related to a large number of perceptual, performance, and clinical phenomena.

VEPs from electrodes over each hemisphere and midline were computer-averaged over 2 min and the average then subjected to spectral (Fourier) analyses. The stimulus reversals were square-wave regulated, and all subjects responded with near sine-wave spectral components (fundamental and some harmonics) at the corresponding reversal frequencies. Each subject developed larger responses at one of the stimulus frequencies (usually 6 Hz). Response magnitude at either the fundamental or harmonics of the stimulus frequency varied greatly across subjects. One of the specific hypotheses tested was that larger VEPs should develop after stimulation of the dominant eye; this could not be demonstrated. Two other hypotheses were verified: (1) VEPs should be lateralized and should correlate with handedness, and (2) some of the response received in a given hemisphere is physiologically relayed to the other hemisphere, and this occurs in both directions. Hemispheric lateralization occurred most clearly at each subject’s optimum frequency. The “dominant” hemisphere for this kind of stimulus was always in the left hemisphere for the five right-handed subjects and in the right hemisphere for four of the left-handed subjects (the other left-hander had marked left-hemisphere dominance and also several right-handed behaviors). © 1980, Psychonomic Society, Inc..

The data were analyzed for four refractive groups (low myopes, high myopes, low hyperopes, high hyperopes) in terms of the degree to which the laser findings correlated with the other objective and subjective techniques for determining spherical error. It was found for all groups that the laser determinations were highly valid. The laser findings were also analyzed for each group to determine the variability of the procedure, and the results confirmed our earlier findings that the technique is also very reliable.

Amblyopia may vary in its depth. Fixation will be eccentric in amblyopia if the central acuity is lower than the surrounding area. This is so in the greater majority of cases of severe amblyopia. A new method for determining and measuring eccentric fixation in amblyopia is discussed. There may or may not be a directional difference in acuity in amblyopic eyes. 50% of patients examined had an amblyopic eye in which the foveal vision was unaffected by the use of the other and in the remaining 50% the amblyopic eye was inhibited by the use of the good eye. All patients with unilateral amblyopia exhibited suppression, which could be divided into four main groups. Visual fields in amblyopia are unaffected peripherally, but depressed centrally. The absolute threshold of light is normal in amblyopic eyes. The spectral sensitivity in amblyopic eyes tends to fall below that of dominant eyes, marked at short waves and insignificant at long wave lengths. Pupillary light reflexes are reduced in amblyopia, when stimulated centrally. Copyright © 1959, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

Laterality of eye functioning is specifically determined by the situation in which the measurement is made. The relationships between the eyes in such specific measurements are not an indication of any cerebral dominance. Sensory neural organization indicates that the problem of central functioning involves determining relationships of the two halves of the retina rather than the two eyes as a whole. The motor functions of the two eyes are controlled by both hemispheres and cannot be studied from the point of view of cerebral dominance. In view of these facts, it should be urged that in the use of the term 'ocular dominance' the specific method of measurement be included in the statement of laterality. From this point of view, even the unqualified use of the term 'sighting eye' is questionable, since the situation frequently determines the eye used in sighting.""

The first hypothesis is based on the assumption that any relationship between mixed hand-eye dominance and reading performance is very likely a function of the dominant eye, rather than the combined hand and eye preference. The second hypothesis assumes that integration of monocular and binoculars functions is an important factor in reading performance. Reading performance of 162 fifth grade parochial school pupils was tested under a control condition and two experimental conditions of disturbed binocular vision. An aniseikonic lens was used to disturb binocular vision without disturbing monocular vision.

""The results reveal no uniform superiority of either hemisphere, and no significant difference between the reaction times of the two hands in a simple reaction experiment when the average of all the reactions is taken. When, however, the reactions of the separate individuals are compared it is found that individuals differ somewhat widely with reference to hemispheral and hand superiority, being divided approximately between superiority of the right and left hemispheres regardless of whether they are right or left handed. The results, therefore, give support to the conclusion that the cerebral hemispheres act together as a unit and that superiority of either one is probably due to certain anatomical and environmental factors determining variability. What precisely these factors are is a matter of conjecture. Eyedness seems to be definitely correlated with handedness and brainedness as regards reaction time.""

Une étude interculturelle de ces variables, effectuée sur des sujets Temne (Sierra Leone) et Arunta (Australie), confirme le modèle proposé: on observe, en effet, 3.4 % de gauchers chez les Temne, agriculteurs et conformistes, tandis qu'apparaît un pourcentage significativement supérieur (10.5) chez les chasseurs Arunta dont la socialisation est plus permissive. En outre, sur 247 femmes appartenant à trois sociétés rurales, on n'a relevé aucun cas de gaucherie, ce qui confirme la thèse de Barry et al. (1957) concernant les pressions conformistes plus fortes envers les femmes au sein des communautés rurales. Les résultats des comparaisons interculturelles de la dominance manuelle et oculaire vont dans le sens des découvertes antérieures. Ainsi, le pourcentage de sujets à dominance croisée (main droite‐œil gauche) atteint chez les Temne le chiffre attendu de 25 à 33%.

In 43 test persons eye dominance in binocular subjective direction (Rosenbach's alignment test) was compared with the sensoric prevalence of one eye. The results show that in 2/3 of this group dominance in binocular subjective direction and dominance in brightness perception (sensoric prevalence) affect the same eye whereas in 1/3 of this group this agreement does not exist.

Reaction time has been found to be a negatively accelerated, decreasing function of increased light intensity. There is a constant relationship between the binocular reaction time and the average monocular reaction time for each O. Equivalent brightnesses under each viewing condition were calculated on the basis of speed of reaction.

Forty Chinese bilingual subjects (20 right-eye dominant and 20 left-eye dominant) were tested for their recall of forms, Chinese words and English words. The stimuli were projected tachistoscopically in the left and/or right VHFs under conditions of simulataneous and successive presentation. The results demonstrated a right field superiority for verbal stimuli under both conditions and a left field superiority for nonverbal stimuli when presented successively. Right-eyed subjects were better in processing verbal materials and left-eyed subjects were better in the perception and recall of nonverbal materials. The study supported the validity of the psychophysiological model of asymmetrical cerebral functioning and demonstrated the importance of reading habits and eye dominance. The findings were interpreted as preliminary support for Piaget's postulated relationship between perceptual and organic development. © 1972.

Members of the four major racial groups in South Africa—Europeans, Coloureds, Indians, and Africans—serve both as judges and as photographic stimulus material. The factor of eye dominance is controlled. While the stimulus material itself accounts for many of the findings, there is clear evidence that ‘directed state’ factors are also at work. White South Africans, especially the Afrikaners, seem to manifest a ‘perceptual vigilance’ in their judgements. They report racially mixed photographs to be either pure European or full‐blooded African more often than do judges of other races. This tendency is consistent with the bifurcation (judgements of ‘black’ or ‘white’) known to be characteristic of people who are apprehensive concerning race relations. The use of meaningful stimuli presented in a setting of binocular rivalry offers new promise for the study of cultural and personal determinants in perception. 1958 The British Psychological Society

This was done by arranging for the moving target only to be viewed through a filter, but not the rest of the display. The usual monotonically increasing function relating Pulfrich effect and filter density was obtained, and inferred retinal latency differences were consistent with those in the literature. The effect was not symmetrical for most observers for the two directions of target motion (left-to-right and right-to-left), and this was attributed to eye dominance and different amounts of experience in judging stereoscopic depth. It is suggested that two processes are confounded in the situation in which the Pulfrich effect is normally measured, namely the differential states of light adaptation caused by the presence of a filter and the decrease in contrast between target and background for the filtered eye. © 1968.

Both eyes were first used together, then the right and then the left alone. For each bisection, the left segment of the line was measured, as a percentage of the total length. The principal results are as follows: (1) There exist for lines of different lengths large systematic differences in the estimated points of bisection. (2) For any one line, the differences of estimation for different eye conditions usually are large. (3) In general, there is a strong resemblance between sets of determinations made by a given subject on different days. (4) The curves of means show that, in general, the results for the two eyes together are in no sense a mean of the two taken singly. (5) Dispersions for both eyes are approximately the same as for each separately. (6) Ocular dominance does not seem to affect the dispersions.

After determining their dominant hand and eye, 28 players from two college baseball teams were divided into groups according to their particular laterality. The resulting groups were composed of crossed laterals and unilaterals. The two laterality groups were then compared in their batting performance. Comparisons were made in such batting departments as: On-base-average; batting average; strike-outs; called strike-outs and missed swings. The unilaterals scored better than the crossed laterals in most batting categories. The batting stances of the unilateral players significantly affected their performances in certain batting categories. The results indicate that eye dominance may have some effect on certain aspects of baseball batting. © 1965 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Chan S.T.; Chang K.S.F.";0.0;Relation of eye dominance and eye closure;1960;Nature;10.1038/185539a0;"IT is a well-known fact that while our vision is binocular, one eye (more often the right than the left) is in fact preferred or dominant in fixation and sighting. Much has been published on this subject, especially in its relation to handedness. We conjectured that if one eye is dominant in sighting, the other, that is, the non-dominant eye, would logically be expected to close more easily in order to enhance the use of the dominant eye, and as a corollary, the dominant eye would be more resistant to closure unilaterally because of the very nature of its dominance. In putting this theory to test, we used the students of our senior and junior anatomy classes (total 145, ranging from 18 to 24) as subjects. Eye dominance was first ascertained by three or more trials of the cone test in each case, and then the subjects were asked to close the right and left eyes singly and alternately for a number of times and to say which eye they found could close with less effort. This latter test was subjective; in some cases, however, we were able to see quite plainly for ourselves. The results of our investigation are given in Table 1. © 1960 Nature Publishing Group."
"Haggard E.A.; Babin R.";0.0;On the problem of 'reinforcement' in conditioning the autokinetic phenomenon;1948;Journal of Experimental Psychology;10.1037/h0058871;"""There were three experimental variables: (a) Motor reinforcement: Movement With (drawing arrows in the same direction as the apparent movement of the light), Movement Against (drawing arrows in the opposite direction), and No Movement (sitting passively); (b) Reward reinforcement: Reward (the presence of both social and monetary reward) and No Reward . . ; and (c) Eye Dominance . . ... The measures used included an Index of Conditioning, the frequency, direction, and magnitude of all horizontal movements of the light, and the degree of the Ss' confidence in their perceptions of the apparent movement of the light. The results permit the following general conclusions: 1. Both the fact and the pattern of motor reinforcement played an important role in conditioning the autokinetic phenomenon in this experiment. The order of effectiveness of the conditions in this variable was: Movement With, Movement Against, and No Movement. 2. The reward reinforcement and eye dominance variables were less effective than motor reinforcement, with Reward and Left Eyedness being superior to the opposing conditions. 3. The difference between the relative effectiveness of the three variables in modifying the autokinetic phenomenon seems to be one of degree."" 34 references.

The right visual field was found more stable than the left. This difference was not related to handedness but was significantly related to ocular dominance. Monocular results yielded significant laterality differences for the left eye, but not the right eye. An interpretation based on sensory cerebral dominance and retinal sensitivity was advanced to account for the results. © 1967.

The conclusions which have been reached are as follows: 1. There is a significant difference in the c.f.f. values between young and old age for both eyes, dominant and non-dominant eye. 2. There are no sex differences in c.f.f. values, in either the young or the old groups. 3. The decrease in c.f.f. in old age is probably due to the degeneration of the optic nerve and cerebrum. 4. The range of the c.f.f. values is greater in old age. From a general consideration of all factors it seems that the c.f.f. test can be useful in gerontological studies."" 28 references.

Updegraff R.;0.0;Ocular dominance in young children;1932;Journal of Experimental Psychology;10.1037/h0074425;"A modification of the Miles A-B-C vision test was used in 396 tests of children two to six years of age. The test proved to be reliable for children from three to six, but did not reliably test the two-year-old children to whom it was given. Whether the test was unsatisfactory in their case or dominance had not been established could not be determined. 60% of the children were right-eyed; 20 to 30% were left-eyed. Results indicated that impartial-eyedness is more common in young children than in older. There were no apparent sex differences. It seems justifiable on the basis of this test to conclude that for many children ocular dominance is not established before the age of three. Consistency in ocular dominance over a period of years was apparent in approximately 75% of the children of whom such testing was possible.

Intermittency rates of 8Hz and 15Hz with pulse to cycle fractions of ¼ and ¾, plus steady, were utilized. A sphere-ring target with a forced choice judgment of the sphere being either before or behind the ring was intermittency being either binocular, or monocular to the dominant eye. Results from four observers indicate that the monocular intermittent condition provided the expected decrement in the 8-10Hz range that previously yielded impoverishment of visual acuity and unique changes in brightness, hue and saturation. The binocular intermittent condition also impaired stereopsis, however not in the 8-10Hz range. It was concluded that present ideas relating acuity and stereopsis are in need of revision. © 1972 American Academy of Optometry.

The magnitude of the binocular versional component was isolated from the change in vergence. The versional component was found to be greater in the dominant eye. This corresponds with the subjective observation of the physiological diplopic images. It is suggested that Hering's Law of equal innervation is applicable to asymmetrical movements only if the position of the binoculus is taken into account. © 1972.

Their task was to adjust the amount of sphere in the phoropter until the speckle pattern of the laser appeared stationary. Each observer made 20 monocular settings using his dominant eye. The data were analyzed for each refractive type (emmetrope, myope, hyperope) in terms of their variability, and it was found for all refractive groups that the phoropter settings were highly reliable. The data showed that when neutrality was approached from a simulated myopic refractive state (over correction with plus) the reliability for all groups was higher than when the initial simulated refractive state was hyperopic (over correction with minus). The results also indicated for all groups that adjustment of the lenses from an initial over correction with plus resulted in less minus correction than when they were adjusted from an initial over correction with minus. © 1972 American Academy of Optometry.
Keller M.;0.0;Ocular dominance and the range of visual apprehension;1937;Journal of Experimental Psychology;10.1037/h0061524;The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ocular dominance on the relative recall of letters falling on the right and left retinal halves of the two eyes. The following tests were used in determining ocular dominance: (1) manoptoscope, (2) stereoscope, (3) paper-sighting, (4) convergence, and (5) cancellation. Monocular tachistoscopic presentation of material was used to determine the range of visual apprehension for stimuli falling in the right and left halves of the retinae in each eye. 46 right-handed and 4 left-handed men served as subjects. Results were as follows: (1) Ocular dominance had no effect on: (a) the range of visual apprehension in either eye and (b) the relative amount of recall of letters on either side of the stimulus card. (2) Both right- and left-handed subjects showed a slight tendency to recall more letters in the right visual field than in the left. Since all but 4 of these subjects were right-handed, this suggests that there may be some relationship between handedness and the relative amount of recall in the right and left visual fields. (3) Coefficients of correlation expressing the degree of functional relationship between the two halves of the same eye were not significant.

Four conditions of stimulation were investigated: (a) monocular flicker, dominant eye; (b) monocular flicker, non-dominant eye; (c) binocular flicker, out-of-phase; and (d) binocular flicker, in-phase. Results indicate clearly that, compared to monocular CFF, the CFF for binocular in-phase stimulation is reliably higher, while that for binocular out-of-phase stimulation is reliably lower. In view of these frequency shifts, obtained during binocular stimulation, it seems necessary to postulate some interaction between the two eyes, an interaction which seems possible only by way of some central mechanism of the brain.""
